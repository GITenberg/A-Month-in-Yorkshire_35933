<h2><a name="FOREWORD_TO_THE_FOURTH_EDITION" id="FOREWORD_TO_THE_FOURTH_EDITION"></a>FOREWORD TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</h2>

<p>The first two editions of this work had not long been published
when I was pelted with animadversions for the &#x201c;scandalous
misrepresentation&#x201d; conveyed in my report of a conversation held
with a villager at Burnsall; which conversation may be read in
the twenty-second chapter. My reply was, that I had set down
less than was spoken&mdash;that I had brought no accusation, not
having even mentioned the &#x201c;innocent-looking country town&#x201d;
as situate in any one of the three Ridings&mdash;that what I had seen,
however, in some of the large towns, led me to infer that the
imputation (if such it were) would hardly fail to apply; and,
moreover, if the Yorkshire conscience felt uneasy, was I to be
held responsible?</p>

<p>My explanation that the town in question was not in Yorkshire,
was treated as of none effect, and my censors rejoined in legal
phrase, that I had no case. So I went about for awhile under a
kind of suspicion, or as an unintentional martyr, until one day
there met me two gentlemen from Leeds, one of whom declared
that he and others, jealous of their county&#x2019;s reputation, and doubting
not to convict me of error, had made diligent inquiry and found
to their discomfiture, that the assemblages implied in the villager&#x2019;s
remark, did actually take place within Yorkshire itself. The discovery
is not one to be proud of; but, having been made, let the
county strive to free itself from at least that reproach.</p>

<p>Another censurable matter was my word of warning against
certain inns which had given me demonstration that their entertainment,
regulated by a sliding scale, went up on the arrival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
a stranger. Yorkshire wrote a flat denial of the implication to
my publishers, and inclosed a copy of what he called &#x201c;his tariff,&#x201d;
by way of proof, which would have been an effectual justification
had my grievance been an invention; but, as it happened, the
tariff presented testimony in my favour, by the difference between
its prices and those which I had been required to pay.</p>

<p>I only notice this incident because of the general question, in
which all who travel are more or less interested. Why should an
Englishman, accustomed to equitable dealings while staying at
home, be required to submit so frequently to the reverse when
journeying in his own country? Shopkeepers are ready to sell
socks, or saddles, or soap without an increase of price on the plea
that they may never see you again, and without expecting you to
fee their servants for placing the article before you; and why
should innkeepers claim a privilege to do otherwise? The numerous
complaints which every season&#x2019;s experience calls forth from
tourists, imply a want of harmony between &#x201c;travelling facilities&#x201d;
and the practice of licensed victuallers; and if English folk are
to be persuaded to travel in their own country, the sooner the required
harmony is established, the better. It would be very easy
to exhibit a table of charges and fees by which a tourist might
ascertain cost beforehand, and choose accordingly. Holland is a
notoriously dear and highly-taxed country, yet fivepence a day
is all the charge that Dutch innkeepers make for &#x201c;attendance.&#x201d;</p>

<p>In one instance the discussion took a humorous turn:&mdash;the name
of a certain jovial host, with whom I had a talk in Swaledale,
appeared subscribed to a letter in the <i>Richmond Chronicle</i>, and as
it furnishes us with a fresh specimen of local dialect, I take leave
to quote a few passages therefrom. After expostulating with the
editor for &#x201c;prentan&#x201d; a letter which somebody had written in his
&#x201c;neame,&#x201d; the writer says, &#x201c;but between ye an&#x2019; me, I believe this
chap&#x2019;s been readin&#x2019; a buke put out by yan White, &#x2019;at was trailin&#x2019;
about t&#x2019; Deales iv hay-time, an&#x2019; afoare he set off to gang by t&#x2019;
butter-tubs to t&#x2019; Hawes, he ast me what publick-house he was to
gang te, an&#x2019; I tell&#x2019;t him t&#x2019; White Hart; an&#x2019; becoz he mebby fand
t&#x2019; shot rayther bigger than a lik&#x2019;d, he&#x2019;s gi&#x2019;en t&#x2019; landlord a wipe iv
his buke aboot t&#x2019; length of his bill, an&#x2019; me aboot t&#x2019; girth o&#x2019; me body&mdash;pity
but he&#x2019;d summat better to rite aboot; but nivver heed, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
nobbut shows &#x2019;at my meat agrees wi&#x2019; me, an&#x2019; &#x2019;at t&#x2019; yal &#x2019;at I brew
&#x2019;s naythur sour ner wake, an&#x2019; &#x2019;at I drink my shar&#x2019; on&#x2019;t mysel: but
if I leet on him, or can mak&#x2019; oot t&#x2019; chap &#x2019;at sent ye t&#x2019; letter, I&#x2019;ll
gi&#x2019; &#x2019;em an on-be-thinkin.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Sheffield, too, has not yet ceased to reprove me for having
published the obvious fact, that the town is frightfully smoky,
and unclean in appearance and in its talk. If I were to make
any alteration in this particular, it would be to give emphasis,
not to lighten the description. A town which permits its trade
to be coerced by ignorance, and where the ultimate argument of
the working-classes is gunpowder or a knock on the head, should
show that the best means have been taken to purify morals as
well as the atmosphere and streets, before it claims to be &#x201c;nothing
like so bad as is represented.&#x201d; But, the proverb which declares
that &#x201c;people who eat garlic are always sure it doesn&#x2019;t smell,&#x201d; will
perhaps never cease to be true.</p>

<p>Of the £14,000,000 worth of woollen and worsted goods exported
in 1859, Yorkshire supplied the largest portion; and still
maintains its reputation for &#x201c;crafty wit and shrinking cloth,&#x201d;
as shewn by the increase in the manufacture of shoddy. One of
the manufacturers at Batley has made known in a printed pamphlet,
that 50,000,000 pounds of rags are at the present time
annually converted into various kinds of so-called woollen goods.
We walk on shoddy as it covers our floors; and we wear shoddy
in our stockings and under-garments, as well as in capes and
overcoats. Turning to mineral products, we find that in 1859,
Yorkshire raised 1,695,842 tons of ironstone, and 8,247,000 tons of
coal, worth in round numbers £3,573,000. And with all this
there is an increase in the means and results of education, and
an abatement of pauperism: in 1820, the poor&#x2019;s-rate in Hull was
seven shillings and eightpence in the pound, in 1860, not more
than eightpence.</p>

<p>And to mention facts of another kind:&mdash;by the digging of a
drain on Marston Moor, a heap of twenty-five or thirty skeletons
was discovered, around which the clay retained the form of the
bodies, like a mould; a bullet fell from one of the skulls, and in
some the teeth were perfectly sound, 213 years after the battle.
At Malton, during a recent excavation of the main street, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
hundred yards of the Roman highway leading from Derby to
York were laid bare, three feet below the present surface.
Scarborough is building new batteries on her castled cliff, and
replacing old guns by new ones; and Hull is about to add to its
resources by the construction of a new dock. The much-needed
harbour of refuge is, however, not yet begun, as wrecks along
the coast after easterly storms lamentably testify.</p>

<p>This <i>Month in Yorkshire</i> was the second of my books of home-travel;
and it was while rambling along the cliffs and over the
hills of the famous county, that I conceived it possible to interest
others as well as myself in the Past and the Present, in the delightful
natural aspects and the wonderful industry of our native
country to a yet wider extent; and therein I have not been
disappointed. To the objection that my works are useless as
guide-books, I answer, that no intelligent reader will find it difficult
to follow my route: distances are mentioned with sufficient
accuracy, the length of my longest day&#x2019;s walk is recorded, whereby
any one, who knows his own strength, may easily plan each day&#x2019;s
journey in anticipation. By aid of the map which accompanies the
present volume either planning or reference will now be facilitated.</p>

<p>Next to ourselves, there is perhaps nothing so interesting to us
as our own country, which may be taken as a good reason why a
book about England finds favour with readers. For my part let
me repeat a passage from the foreword to the second edition:&mdash;&#x201c;I
know that I have an earnest love for my subject; feeling proud
of the name of Englishman, and the freedom of thought, speech,
and action therein involved; loving our fields and lanes, our hills
and moorlands, and the shores of our sea, and delighting much to
wander among them. Happy shall I be if I can inspire the
reader with the like emotions.&#x201d;</p>

<span class="smaller">A SHORT CHAPTER TO BEGIN WITH.</span></h2>

<p>I had cheerful recollections of Yorkshire. My first lessons
in self-reliance and long walks were learned in that county.
I could not forget how, fresh from the south, I had been as
much astonished at the tall, stalwart forms of the men, their
strange rustic dialect and rough manners, as by their hearty
hospitality. Nor could I fail to remember the contrast
between the bleak outside of certain farm-houses and the
rude homely comfort inside, where a ruddy turf fire glowed
on the hearth, and mutton hams, and oaten bread, and store
of victual burdened the racks of the kitchen ceiling. Nor
the generous entertainment of more than one old hostess in
little roadside public-houses, who, when I arrived at nightfall,
weary with travel, would have me sit at the end of the
high-backed settle nearest the fire, or in the &#x2018;neukin&#x2019; under
the great chimney, and bustle about with motherly kindness
to get tea ready; who, before I had eaten the first pile of
cakes, would bring a second, with earnest assurance that a
&#x201c;growing lad&#x201d; could never eat too much; who talked so
sympathisingly during the evening&mdash;I being at times the only
guest&mdash;wondering much that I should be so far away from
home: had I no friends? where was I going? and the like;
who charged me only eighteenpence for tea, bed, and breakfast,
and once slily thrust into my pocket, at parting, a couple
of cakes, which I did not discover till half way across a snow-drifted
moor, where no house was in sight for many miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
All this, and much more which one does not willingly forget,
haunted my memory.</p>

<p>The wild scenery of the fells, the tame agricultural region,
and the smoky wapentakes, where commerce erects more
steeples than religion, were traversed during my rambles.
While wandering in the neighbourhood of Keighley, I had
seen Charlotte Brontë&#x2019;s birthplace, long before any one
dreamed that she would one day flash as a meteor upon the
gaze of the &#x201c;reading public.&#x201d; Rosebury Topping had become
familiar to me in the landscapes of Cleveland, and now a
desire possessed me to get on the top of that magnificent
cone. In the villages round about its base I had shared the
pepper-cake of Christmas-tide; and falling in with the ancient
custom prevalent along the eastern coast from Humber to
Tyne, had eaten fried peas on Carlin Sunday&mdash;Mid-Lent of
the calendar&mdash;ere the discovery of that mineral wealth, now
known to exist in such astonishing abundance, that whether
the British coal-fields will last long enough or not to smelt all
the ironstone of Cleveland, is no longer a question with a
chief of geologists. I had mused in the ruin where Richard
the Second was cruelly murdered, at Pontefract; had looked
with proper surprise at the Dropping Well, at Knaresborough,
and into St. Robert&#x2019;s Cave, the depository of Eugene Aram&#x2019;s
terrible secret; had walked into Wakefield, having scarcely
outlived the fond belief that there the Vicar once dwelt with
his family; and when the guard pointed out the summits as
the coach rolled past on the way from Skipton to Kirkby
Lonsdale, had no misgivings as to the truth of the saying:</p>

<span class="i0">Are the three highest hills all England thorough.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Unawares, in some instances, I had walked across battlefields,
memorable alike in the history of the county, and of
the kingdom; where marauding Scots, dissolute Hainaulters,
Plantagenets and Tudors, Cavalier and Roundhead had rushed
to the onslaught. Marston Moor awoke the proudest emotions,
notwithstanding my schoolboy recollections of what
David Hume had written thereupon; while Towton was something
to wonder at, as imagination flew back to the time when</p>

<p>Did the decrepit old shambles, roofed with paving-flags,
still encumber the spacious market-place at Thirsk? Did the
sexton at Ripon Minster still deliver his anatomical lecture in
the grim bone-house, and did the morality of that sedate town
still accord with the venerable adage, &#x201c;as true steel as Ripon
rowels?&#x201d; Was York still famous for muffins, or Northallerton
for quoits, cricket, and spell-and-nurr? and was its beer
as good as when Bacchus held a court somewhere within sight
of the three Ridings, and asked one of his attendants where
that new drink, &#x201c;strong and mellow,&#x201d; was to be found? and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;The boon good fellow answered, &#x2018;I can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">North-Allerton, in Yorkshire, doth excel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All England, nay, all Europe, for strong ale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thither we adjourn we shall not fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To taste such humming stuff, as I dare say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Highness never tasted to this day.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hence, when the summer sun revived my migratory
instinct, I inclined to ramble once more in Yorkshire. There
would be no lack of the freshness of new scenes, for my former
wanderings had not led me to the coast, nor to the finest
of the old abbeys&mdash;those ruins of wondrous beauty, nor to the
remote dales where crowding hills abound with the pictur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>esque.
Here was novelty enough, to say nothing of the
people and their ways, and the manifold appliances and results
of industry which so eminently distinguish the county, and
the grand historical associations of the metropolitan city, once
the &#x201c;other Rome,&#x201d; of which the old rhymester says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Let London still the just precedence claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">York ever shall be proud to be the next in fame.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I was curious, moreover, to observe whether the peculiar
dialect or the old habits were dying out quite so rapidly as
some social and political economists would have us believe.</p>

<p>Quaint old Fuller, among the many nuggets imbedded in
his pages, has one which implies that Yorkshire being the
biggest is therefore the best county in England. You may
take six from the other thirty-nine counties, and put them
together, and not make a territory so large as Yorkshire.
The population of the county numbers nearly two millions.
When within it you find the distances great from one extremity
to the other, and become aware of the importance
involved in mere dimensions. In no county have Briton,
Roman, and Dane left more evident traces, or history more
interesting waymarks. Speed says of it: &#x201c;She is much
bound to the singular love and motherly care of Nature, in
placing her under so temperate a clime, that in every measure
she is indifferently fruitful. If one part of her be stone,
and a sandy barren ground, another is fertile and richly
adorned with corn-fields. If you here find it naked and destitute
of woods, you shall see it there shadowed with forests
full of trees, that have very thick bodies, sending forth many
fruitful and profitable branches. If one place of it be moorish,
miry, and unpleasant, another makes a free tender of
delight, and presents itself to the eye full of beauty and contentive
variety.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Considering, furthermore, that for two years in succession
I had seen the peasantry in parts of the north and south of
Europe, and had come to the conclusion (under correction, for
my travel is brief) that the English labourer, with his weekly
wages, his cottage and garden, is better off than the peasant
proprietor of Germany and Tyrol,&mdash;considering this, I wished
to prove my conclusion, and therefore started hopefully for
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>And again, does not Emerson say, &#x201c;a wise traveller will
naturally choose to visit the best of actual nations.&#x201d;</p>

<p>As the <i>Vivid</i> steamed past the Spurn lighthouse, I looked
curiously at the low sandy spit on which the tall red tower
stands, scarcely as it seems above the level of the water,
thinking that my first walk would perhaps lead thither. At
sight of the Pharos, and of the broad estuary alive with
vessels standing in, the Yorkshiremen on board felt their
patriotism revive, and one might have fancied there was a
richer twang in their speech than had been perceptible in the
latitude of London. A few who rubbed their hands and
tried to look hearty, vowed that their future travels should
not be on the sea. The <i>Vivid</i> is not a very sprightly boat,
but enjoys or not, as the case may be, a reputation for safety,
and for sleeping-cabins narrower and more stifling than any I
ever crept into. But one must not expect too much when the
charge for a voyage of twenty-six hours is only six and sixpence
in the chief cabin.</p>

<p>Not without reason does old Camden remark of the
Humber, &#x201c;it is a common rendezvous for the greatest part
of the rivers hereabouts,&#x201d; for it is a noble estuary, notwithstanding
that water and shore are alike muddy. It is nearly
forty miles long, with a width of more than two miles down
to about three leagues from the lighthouse, where it widens to
six or seven miles, offering a capacious entrance to the sea.
The water has somewhat of an unctuous appearance, as if
overcharged with contributions of the very fattest alluvium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
from all parts of Yorkshire. The results may be seen on the
right, as we ascend. There spreads the broad level of Sunk
Island, a noteworthy example of dry land produced by the
co-operation of natural causes and human industry. The
date of its first appearance above the water is not accurately
known; but in the reign of Charles II. it was described as
three thousand five hundred acres of &#x201c;drowned ground,&#x201d;
of which seven acres were enclosed by embankments; and
was let at five pounds a year. A hundred years later fifteen
hundred acres were under cultivation, producing a yearly
rental of seven hundred pounds to the lessee; but he, it is
said, made but little profit, because of the waste and loss
occasioned by failure of the banks and irruptions of the tides.
In 1802 the island reverted to the Crown, and was re-let on
condition that all the salt marsh&mdash;nearly three thousand acres&mdash;which
was &#x201c;ripe for embankment,&#x201d; should be taken in,
and that a church and proper houses should be built, to
replace the little chapel and five cottages which ministered as
little to the edification as to the comfort of the occupants.
In 1833 the lease once more fell in, and the Woods and
Forests, wisely ignoring the middlemen, let the lands directly
to the &#x2018;Sunk farmers,&#x2019; as they are called in the neighbourhood,
and took upon themselves the construction and maintenance
of the banks. A good road was made, and bridges were
built to connect the Island with the main, and as the accumulations
of alluvium still went on, another &#x2018;intake&#x2019; became
possible in 1851, and now there are nearly 7000 acres,
comprising twenty-three farms, besides a few small holdings,
worth more than 12,000<i>l.</i> of annual rent. It forms a parish
of itself, and not a neglected one; for moral reclamation is
cared for as well as territorial. The clergyman has a sufficient
stipend; the parishioners supplemented the grants made by
Government and the Council of Education, and have now a
good schoolhouse and a competent schoolmaster.</p>

<p>The Island will continue to increase in extent and value as
long as the same causes continue to operate; and who shall
set limits to them? Already the area is greater than that
described in the last report of the Woods and Forests, which
comprehends only the portion protected by banks. The land
when reclaimed is singularly fertile, and free from stones, and
proves its quality in the course of three or four years, by producing
spontaneously a rich crop of white clover. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
fact, interesting to naturalists, was mentioned by Mr. Oldham
in a report read before the British Association, at their meeting
in Hull. &#x201c;When the land, or rather mud-bank, has
nearly reached the usual surface elevation, the first vegetable
life it exhibits is that of samphire, then of a very thin wiry
grass, and after this some other varieties of marine grass; and
when the surface is thus covered with vegetation, the land
may at once be embanked; but if it is enclosed from the tide
before it obtains a green carpet, it may be for twenty years of
but little value to agriculture, for scarcely anything will grow
upon it.&#x201d;</p>

<p>This is not the only place on the eastern coast where we
may see artificial land, and banks, dikes, and other defences
against the water such as are commonly supposed to be peculiar
to the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The windows of Cleathorpes twinkling afar in the morning
sun, reveal the situation of a watering-place on the opposite
shore much frequented by Lincolnshire folk. Beyond rises
the tall and graceful tower of Grimsby Docks, serving at once
as signal tower and reservoir of the water-power by which
the cranes and other apparatus are worked, and ships laden
and unladen with marvellous celerity. These docks cover a
hundred acres of what a few years ago was a great mud-flat,
and are a favourable specimen of what can be accomplished
by the overhasty enterprise of the present day. Grimsby on
her side of the river now rivals Hull on the other, with the
advantage of being nearer the sea, whereby some miles of
navigation are avoided.</p>

<p>Turning to the right again we pass Foul Holme Sand, a
long narrow spit, covered at half-tide, which some day may
become reclaimable. A little farther and there is the church
of Paghill or Paul, standing on a low hill so completely
isolated from the broken village to which it belongs, that the
distich runs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;High Paul, and Low Paul, Paul, and Paul Holme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was never a fair maid married in Paul town.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The vessel urges her way onwards across swirls and eddies
innumerable which betray the presence of shoals and the
vigorous strife of opposing currents. The spring tides rise
twenty-two feet, and rush in with a stream at five miles an
hour, noisy and at times dangerous, churning the mud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
shifting it from one place to another, to the provocation of
pilots. It is mostly above Hull that the changes take place,
and there they are so sudden and rapid that a pilot may find
the channel by which he had descended shifted to another
part of the river on his return a few days afterwards. There
also islands appear and disappear in a manner truly surprising,
and in the alternate loss or gain of the shores may be witnessed
the most capricious of phenomena. Let one example
suffice: a field of fourteen acres, above Ferriby, was reduced
to less than four acres in twenty years, although the farmer
during that time had constructed seven new banks for the
defence of his land.</p>

<p>Some notion of the enormous quantity of mud which enters
the great river may be formed from the fact that fifty thousand
tons of mud have been dredged in one year from the docks
and basins at Hull. The steam-dredge employed in the work
lifts fifty tons of mud in an hour, pours it into lighters, which
when laden drop down with the tide, and discharge their
slimy burden in certain parts of the stream, where, as is said,
it cannot accumulate.</p>

<p>Stukely, who crossed the estuary during one of his itineraries,
remarks: &#x201c;Well may the Humber take its name from
the noise it makes. My landlord, who is a sailor, says in a
high wind &#x2019;tis incredibly great and terrible, like the crash and
dashing together of ships.&#x201d; The learned antiquary alludes
probably to the bore, or ager as it is called, which rushes up
the stream with so loud a <i>hum</i> that the popular mind seeks no
other derivation for Humber. Professor Phillips, in his admirable
book on Yorkshire, cites the Gaelic word <i>Comar</i>, a
confluence of two or more waters, as the origin; and Dr.
Latham suggests that Humber may be the modified form of
Aber or Inver. Drayton, in <i>Polyolbion</i>, chants of a tragical
derivation; and as I take it for granted, amicable reader, that
you do not wish to travel in a hurry, we will pause for a few
minutes to listen to the debate of the rivers, wherein &#x201c;thus
mighty Humber speaks:&#x201d;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;My brave West Riding brooks, your king you need not scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud Naiades neither ye, North Riders that are born,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Th&#x2019; East Riding by thy rise, do homage to your king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the sea-nymphs thus of mighty Humber sing;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For when my Higre comes, I make my either shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even tremble with the sound, that I afar do send.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The view of Hull seen from the water is much more smoky
than picturesque. Coming nearer we see the <i>Cornwallis</i>
anchored off the citadel, looking as trim and earnest as one
fancies an English seventy-four ought to look, and quite in
keeping with the embrasured walls through which guns are
peeping on shore. The quay and landing-places exhibit multifarious
signs of life, especially if your arrival occur when
the great railway steam-ferry-boat is about to start. There
is, however, something about Hull which inspires a feeling of
melancholy. This was my third visit, and still the first impression
prevailed. It may be the dead level, or the sleepy
architecture, or the sombre colour, or a combination of the
three, that touches the dismal key. &#x201c;Memorable for mud
and train oil&#x201d; was what Etty always said of the town in
which he served an apprenticeship of seven weary years;
yet in his time there remained certain picturesque features
which have since disappeared with the large fleet of Greenland
whale-ships whereof the town was once so proud:&mdash;now
migrated to Peterhead. However, we must not forget that
Hull is the third port in the kingdom; that nearly a hundred
steamers arrive and depart at regular intervals from over sea,
or coastwise, or from up the rivers; that of the 4000 tons of
German yeast now annually imported, worth nearly £200,000,
it receives more than two-thirds; that it was one of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
places to demonstrate the propulsion of vessels by the power
of steam. Nor will we forget that we are in one of the
towns formerly held in wholesome dread by evil-doers when
recommendation to mercy was seldom heard of, as is testified
by the thieves&#x2019; litany of the olden time, thus irreverently
phrased:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;From Hull, Hell, and Halifax,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Lord deliver us.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Halifax, however, stood pre-eminent for sharp practice; a
thief in that parish had no chance of stealing twice, for if he
stole to the value of thirteenpence halfpenny, he was forthwith
beheaded.</p>

<p>Andrew Marvell need not have been so severe upon the
Dutch, considering how much there was in his native county
similar in character and aspect to that which he satirised.
You soon discover that this character still prevails. Is not
the southern landing place of the steam-ferry named New
Holland? and here in Hull, whichever way you look, you
see masts, and are stopped by water or a bridge half open, or
just going to open, whichever way you walk. It is somewhat
puzzling at first; but a few minutes&#x2019; survey from the top of
the High Church affords an explanation.</p>

<p>Following the line once occupied by the old fortifications&mdash;the
walls by which Parliament baffled the king&mdash;the docks
form a continuous water-communication from the river Hull
on one side to the Humber on the other, so that a considerable
portion of the town has become an island, and the sight
of masts and pennons in all directions, some slowly moving,
is accounted for. At the opening of the Junction Dock in
1829, whereby the desired connection was established, the
celebration included circumnavigation of the insular portion
by a gaily decorated steamer.</p>

<p>The amphibious Dutch-looking physiognomy thus produced
is further assisted by the presence of numerous windmills in
the outskirts, and the levelness of the surrounding country.
A hundred years ago, and the view across what is now cultivated
fields would have comprehended as much water as land,
if not more. Should a certain popular authoress ever publish
her autobiography, she will, perhaps, tell us how Mr. Stickney,
her father, used when a boy to skate three or four miles to
school over unreclaimed flats within sight of this church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
tower of Hull, now rich in grass and grain. Only by a
system of drainage and embankment on a great scale, and
a careful maintenance, has the reclamation of this and other
parts of Holderness been accomplished. Taylor, the water-poet,
who was here in 1632, records,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;It yearly costs five hundred pounds besides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fence the towne from Hull and Humber&#x2019;s tydes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For stakes, for bavins, timber, stones, and piles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All which are brought by water many miles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For workmen&#x2019;s labour, and a world of things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which on the towne excessive charges brings.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>British liberty owes something to this superabundance of
water. Hull was the first town in the kingdom to shut its
gates against the king and declare for the people, and was
in consequence besieged by Charles. In this strait, Sir John
Hotham, the governor, caused the dikes to be cut and sluices
drawn, and laid the whole neighbourhood under water, and
kept the besiegers completely at bay. The Royalists, to
retaliate, dug trenches to divert the stream of fresh water
that supplied the town,&mdash;a means of annoyance to which
Hull, from its situation, was always liable. In the good old
times, when the neighbouring villagers had any cause of
quarrel with the townsfolk, they used to throw carrion and
other abominations into the channel, or let in the salt-water,
nor would they desist until warned by a certain Pope in an
admonitory letter.</p>

<p>The church itself, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, is a
handsome specimen of florid Gothic, dating from the reign
of Edward II. You will perhaps wish that the effect of the
light tall columns, rising to the blue panelled roof, were not
weakened by the somewhat cold and bare aspect of the interior.
If you are curious about bells, there are inscriptions
to be deciphered on some of those that hang in the tower;
and in the belfry you may see mysterious tables hanging on
the wall of &#x2018;grandsire bobs,&#x2019; and &#x2018;grandsire tripples;&#x2019;
things in which the ringers take pride, but as unintelligible
to the uninitiated as Babylonish writing. There, too, hangs
the ringers&#x2019; code of laws, and a queer code it is! One of
the articles runs:&mdash;&#x201c;Every Person who shall Ring any Bell
with his Hat or Spurs on, shall Forfeit and Pay Sixpence,
for the Use of the Ringers.&#x201d; And the same fine is levied
from &#x201c;any Person who shall have Read Any of these Orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
with his Hat upon his Head;&#x201d; from which, and the characteristic
touches in the other &#x201c;orders,&#x201d; you will very likely
come to some strange conclusions respecting the fraternity of
ringers.</p>

<p>The market-place is in the main street, where a gilt equestrian
statue of William III. looks down on stalls of fruit,
fish, and seaweed, and the moving crowd of townsfolk and
sailors. By the side of the Humber dock rises the Wilberforce
monument, a tall column, bearing on its capital a statue
of the renowned advocate of the negroes. And when you
have looked at these and at the hospital, and walked through
the garrison, you will have visited nearly all that is monumental
in Hull.</p>

<p>At low water, the little river Hull is a perfect representation
of a very muddy ditch. While crossing the ferry to the
citadel, the old boatman told me he could remember when
every high tide flowed up into the streets of the town, but the
new works for the docks now keep the water out. Hundreds
of piles were driven into the sandy bank to establish a firm
foundation for the massive walls, quays, and abutments. At
the time when timber rose to an enormous price in consequence
of Napoleon&#x2019;s continental blockade, the piles of the coffer-dam
which had been buried seven years, were pulled up and sold
for more than their original cost. Government gave the site
of some old military works and 10,000<i>l.</i> towards the formation
of the first dock, on condition that it should be made deep
enough to receive ships of fifty guns.</p>

<p>In records of the reign of Henry VIII. there appears&mdash;&#x201c;Item:
the Kinges Ma&#x2019;tes house to be made to serve as a
Sitidell and a speciall kepe of the hole town.&#x201d; The present
citadel has an antiquated look, and quiet withal, for the whole
garrison, at the time I walked through it, numbered only
twenty-five artillerymen. Judging from my own experience,
one part of the sergeant&#x2019;s duty is to shout at inquisitive
strangers who get up on the battery to look through an embrasure,
and the more vehemently as they feign not to hear
till their curiosity is satisfied. There is room in the magazines
for twenty thousand stand of arms, and ordnance stores
for a dozen ships of the line. A ditch fed from the Hull
completely separates the fortifications from the neighbouring
ship-yards.</p>

<p>Half a day&#x2019;s exploration led me to the conclusion that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
most cheerful quarter of Hull is the cemetery. I was sitting
there on a grassy bank enjoying the breeze, when a countryman
came up who perhaps felt lonely, for he sat down by my
side, and in less than a minute became autobiographical. He
was a village carpenter, &#x201c;came forty mile out of Lincolnshire&#x201d;
for the benefit of his health; had been waiting three days for
his brother&#x2019;s ship, in which he meant to take a voyage to
China, and feeling dull walked every day to the cemetery;
for, he said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the pleasantest place I can find about the
town.&#x201d; I suggested reading as a relief; but he &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t
make much out o&#x2019;readin&#x2019;&mdash;&#x2019;ud rather work the jack-plane all
day than read.&#x201d; The long voyage to China appeared to offer
so good an opportunity for improving himself in this particular
that I urged him to take a few books on board, and gave an
assurance that one hour&#x2019;s study every day would enable him
to read with pleasure by the time he returned.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Oh, but we be on&#x2019;y three days a-going,&#x201d; he answered.</p>

<p>I had played the part of an adviser to no purpose, for it
appeared, on further questioning, that his brother&#x2019;s ship was
a small sloop trading to some port beyond the North Sea
about three days distant; he did not know where it was, but
was sure his brother called it China. I mentioned the names
of all the ports I could think of to discover the real one if
possible, but in vain; nor have I yet found one that has the
sound of China.</p>

<p>One thing I saw on my way back to the town, which
London&mdash;so apt to be self-conceited&mdash;might adopt with signal
advantage. It was a huge iron roller drawn by horses up and
down a newly macadamised road. Under the treatment of
the ponderous cylinder, the broken stone, combined with a
sprinkling of asphalte, is reduced to a firm and level surface,
over which vehicles travel without any of that distressing
labour and loss of time and temper so often witnessed in the
metropolis, where a thousand pair of wheels produce less
solidity in a week than the roller would in a day; especially
on the spongy roads presided over by St. Pancras.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, while walking about the streets, even
in the principal thoroughfares, I saw evidences enough of&mdash;to
use a mild adjective&mdash;an unpolished population. The
northern characteristics were strongly marked.</p>

<p>By the first train on the morrow I started for Patrington.
The windmills on the outskirts of the town were soon left
behind, and away we went between the thick hedgerows and
across the teeming fields, which, intersected by broad deep
drains, and grazed by sleek cattle, exhibit at once to your
eye the peculiarities of Holderness. All along between the
railway and the river there are thousands of acres, formerly
called the &#x2018;out-marshes,&#x2019; which have been reclaimed, and
now yield wonderful crops of oats. After the principal bank
has been constructed, the tide is let in under proper control
to a depth of from three to five feet, and is left undisturbed
until all the mud held in suspension is deposited. The impoverished
flood is then discharged through the sluices, and
in due time, after the first has stiffened, a fresh flow is admitted.
By this process of &#x2018;warping,&#x2019; as it is called, three or
four feet of mud will be thrown down in three years, covering
the original coarse, sour surface with one abounding in the
elements of fertility. Far inland, even up the Trent, and
around the head of the Humber within reach of the tide, the
farmers have recourse to warping, and not unfrequently
prefer a fresh layer of mud to all other fertilisers.</p>

<p>About every two miles we stop at a station, and at each
there is something to be noted and remembered. Hedon, a dull
decayed town, now two miles from the river, once the commercial
rival of Hull, has something still to be proud of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
its noble church, &#x201c;the pride of Holderness.&#x201d; Here, too,
within a fence, stands the ancient cross, which, after several
removals, as the sea devoured its original site&mdash;a royal adventurer&#x2019;s
landing-place&mdash;found here a permanent station.
At Burstwick, two miles farther, lay the estates, the <i>caput
baroniæ</i>, of the renowned Earls of Albemarle. A few minutes
more and another stop reminds us of Keyingham bridge,
where a party of the men of Holderness opposed the passage
of Edward IV. with his three hundred Flemings, some carrying
strange fire-weapons, until he replied to their resolute
question that he had only come to claim his dukedom of York.
A &#x201c;dukedom large enough&#x201d; for a wise man. And, as tradition
tells, Keyingham church was the scene of a miracle in
1392, when all the doors were split by a lightning-stroke, and
the tomb of Master Philip Ingleberd, formerly rector, sweated
a sweetly-scented oil, perhaps out of gratitude to the patron
saint for the escape of thirteen men who fell all at once with
the ladder while seeking to put out the fire in the steeple,
and came to no harm. Then Winestead, which was, if the
parish-register may be believed, the birthplace of Andrew
Marvell&mdash;not Hull, as is commonly reported of the incorruptible
Yorkshire man. His father was rector here, but removed
to Hull during the poet&#x2019;s infancy, which may account for the
error. The font in which he was christened having fallen
into neglect, was used as a horse-trough, until some good antiquary
removed it into the grounds of Mr. Owst, at Keyingham,
where it remains safe among other relics. Andrew
represented Hull in parliament for twenty years, and was the
last member who, according to old usage, received payment
for his services. One&#x2019;s thought kindles in thinking of him
here at this quiet village, as a friend of Milton, like him using
his gifts manfully and successfully in defence of the Englishman&#x2019;s
birthright. What a happy little glimpse we get of him
in the lines&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Then Patrington&mdash;erst Patrick&#x2019;s town&mdash;one of those simple-looking
places which contrast agreeably with towns sophisticated
by the clamour and bustle of trade; and although a
few gas-lamps tell of innovation, a market not more than
once a fortnight upholds the authority of ancient usage. You
see nearly the whole of the town at once; a long, wide, quiet
street, terminated by a graceful spire, so graceful, indeed, that
it will allure you at once to the church from which it springs;
and what a feast for the eye awaits you! Truly the &#x201c;pride
of Holderness&#x201d; is not monopolised by Hedon. The style is
that which prevailed in the reign of Edward II., and is harmonious
throughout, from weathercock to door-sill. You will
walk round it again and again, admiring the beauty of its design
and proportion, pausing oft to contemplate the curious
carvings, and the octagonal spire springing lightly from flying
buttresses to a height of one hundred and ninety feet. The
gargoyles exhibit strange conceits; chiselled to represent
a fiddler&mdash;a bagpiper&mdash;a man holding a pig&mdash;a fiend griping
a terrified sinner&mdash;a lion thrusting his tongue out&mdash;and others
equally incongruous. How I wished the architect would come
to life for an hour to tell me what he meant by them, and by
certain full-length figures carved on the buttresses, which accord
so little with our modern sense of decency, much less
with the character of a religious house! Inside you find a
corresponding lightness and gracefulness, and similarly relieved
by a sprinkling of monsters. The east or &#x2018;Ladye aisle&#x2019; contains
three chantry chapels; the &#x2018;Easter sepulchre&#x2019; is a rare
specimen of the sculptor&#x2019;s art, and the font hewn from a single
block of granite displays touches of a master hand. St.
Patrick&#x2019;s church at Patrington is an edifice to linger in; an
example of beauty in architecture in itself worth a journey
to Yorkshire.</p>

<p>There are relics, too, of an earlier age: embankments discovered
some feet below the present surface, fragments of
buildings, an altar, and other objects of especial interest to the
antiquary, for they mark Patrington as the site of a Roman
station. An important station, if the supposition be correct
that this was the Prætorium of Antoninus&mdash;the place where
some of the legions disembarked to subjugate the Brigantes.</p>

<p>To eat breakfast under the sign of the <i>Hildyard Arms</i>&mdash;a
name, by the way, which preserves in a modified form the old
Saxon <i>Hildegarde</i>&mdash;seemed like connecting one&#x2019;s-self with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
remote antiquity. The ancestors of the Hildyards were here
before the Conquest. One of the family, Sir Christopher, is
commemorated by a handsome monument in Winestead
church. The landlord, willing to entertain in more ways than
one, talked of the improvements that had taken place within
his remembrance. The railway was not one of them, for it
took away trade from the town, and deadened the market.
Visitors were but few, and most of those who came wondered
at seeing so beautiful a church in such an out-of-the-way
place. He could show me a garden near the churchyard
which was said to be the spot where the building-stone was
landed from boats; but the water had sunk away hundreds of
years ago. Patrington haven&mdash;a creek running up from the
Humber&mdash;had retreated from the town, and since the reclamation
of Sunk Island, required frequent dredging to clear it of
mud. The farmers in the neighbourhood were very well content
with the harvests now yielded by the land. In 1854
some of them reaped &#x201c;most wonderful crops.&#x201d;</p>

<p>I had seen a woman painting her door-posts, and asked him
whether that was recognised as women&#x2019;s work in Patrington.
&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he answered, &#x201c;all over the country too. Women do
the whitewashing, and painting, ay, and the paper-hanging.
Look at this room, now! My daughter put that up.&#x201d;</p>

<p>I did look, and saw that the pattern on the walls sloped
two or three inches from the perpendicular, whereby opposite
sides of the room appeared to be leaning in contrary directions.
However, I said nothing to disparage the damsel&#x2019;s merits.</p>

<p>From Patrington to Spurn the distance is thirteen miles.
Hoping to walk thither and back in the day, I snapped the
thread of the landlord&#x2019;s talk, and set out for the lighthouse.
Presently I overtook a man, and we had not walked half a
mile together before I knew that he was a master-painter in a
small way at Patrington, now going to paper a room at Skeffling,
a village five miles off. To hear that he would get only
sixpence a piece for the hanging surprised me, for I thought
that nowhere out of London would any one be silly enough to
hang paper for a halfpenny a yard.</p>

<p>&#x201c;You see,&#x201d; he rejoined, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s three in the trade at
Patrington, and then &#x2019;tis only the bettermost rooms that we
gets to do. The women does all the rest, and the painting besides.
That&#x2019;s where it is. But &#x2019;taint such a very bad job as
I be going to. They finds their own paste, and there&#x2019;s nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
pieces to hang: that&#x2019;ll give me four and sixpence; and then
I shall get my dinner, and my tea too, if I don&#x2019;t finish too
soon. So it&#x2019;ll be a pretty fair day&#x2019;s work.&#x201d; And yet the
chances were that he would have to wait six months for payment.</p>

<p>We passed through Welwick&mdash;place of wells&mdash;a small,
clean village, with a small, squat church, with carvings sadly
mutilated on the outside, and inside, a handsome tomb. At
Plowland, near this, lived the Wrights, confederates in the
Gunpowder Plot. Nearly all the cottages are models of cleanliness;
the door-sill and step washed with yellow ochre, and
here and there you see through the open door that the walls of
the room inside are papered, and the little pictures and simple
ornaments all in keeping. You will take pleasure in these
indications, and perhaps believe them to be the result of an
affection for cleanliness. The walls of some of the houses and
farm-yards are built of pebbles&mdash;&#x2018;sea-cobbles,&#x2019; as they are
called&mdash;placed zigzag-wise, with a novel and pretty effect:
and the examples multiply as we get nearer the sea, where
they may be seen in the walls of the churches.</p>

<p>At Skeffling the painter turned into a farm-house which
looked comfortably hospitable enough to put him at ease
regarding his dinner, and as if it had little need to take six
months&#x2019; credit for four and sixpence, while I turned from the
high-road into a track leading past the church&mdash;which, by the
way, has architectural features worthy examination&mdash;to the
coarse and swarthy flats where the distant view is hidden by
a great embankment that runs along their margin for miles.
Once on the top of this &#x2018;Humber-bank,&#x2019; I met a lusty
breeze sweeping in from the sea, and had before me a singular
prospect&mdash;the bank itself stretching far as the eye can see
in a straight line to the east and west, covered with coarse
grass and patches of gray, thistle-like, sea-holly&mdash;<i>Eryngo
maritima</i>. Its outer sloop is loose sand falling away to the
damp line left by the tide, beyond which all is mud&mdash;a great
brown expanse outspread for miles. The tide being at its
lowest, only the tops of the masts of small vessels are to be
seen, moving, as it seems, mysteriously: the river itself is
hardly discernible. In places the mud lies smooth and slimy;
in others thickly rippled, or tossed into billows, as if the water
had stamped thereon an impression of all its moods. Fishermen
wade across it in huge boots from their boats to the firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
beach, and dig down through it two or three feet to find stiff
holding-ground for their anchors.</p>

<p>Yonder rises the lighthouse, surprisingly far, as it seems,
to seaward, at times half hidden by a thin, creeping haze.
And from Spurn to Sunk Island this whole northern shore is
of the same brown, monotonous aspect: a desert, where the
only living things are a few sea-birds, wheeling and darting
rapidly, their white wings flashing by contrast with the sad-coloured
shore.</p>

<p>I walked along the top of the bank to Kilnsea, deceived
continually in my estimate of distance by the long dead level.
Here and there a drain pierces the bank, and reappears on the
outer side as a raised sewer, with its outlet beyond high-water
mark; and these constructions, as well as the waifs and strays&mdash;old
baskets and dead seagulls&mdash;cheat the eye strangely as to
their magnitude when first seen. At times, after a lashing
storm has swept off a few acres of the mud, the soil beneath
is found to be a mixture of peat and gravel, in which animal
and vegetable remains and curious antiquities are imbedded.
Now and then the relics are washed out, and show by their
character that they once belonged to Burstall Priory, a religious
house, despoiled by the sea before King Harry began
his Reformation. Burstall Garth, one of the pastures traversed
by the bank, preserves its name: the building itself has
utterly disappeared.</p>

<p>Suddenly a gap occurs in the bank, showing where the
unruly tide has broken through. For some reason the mischief
was not repaired, but a new bank was constructed of chalk
and big pebbles, about a stone&#x2019;s throw to the rear. A green,
slimy pool still lies in a hollow between the two.</p>

<p>The entertainment at the <i>Crown and Anchor</i> at Kilnsea by
no means equals the expectations of a stranger who reads the
host&#x2019;s aristocratic name&mdash;<i>Metforth Tennison</i>&mdash;over the door.
I found the bread poor; the cheese poorer; the beer poorest;
yet was content therewith, knowing that vicissitude is good
for a man. The place itself has a special interest, telling, so
to speak, its own history&mdash;a history of desolation. The wife,
pointing to the road passing between the house and the beach,
told me she remembered Kilnsea church standing at the
seaward end of the village, with as broad a road between it
and the edge of the cliff. But year by year, as from time
immemorial the sea advanced, the road, fields, pastures, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
cottages were undermined and melted away. Still the church
stood, and though it trembled as the roaring waves smote the
cliff beneath, and the wind howled around its unsheltered
walls, service was held within it up to 1823. In that year it
began to yield, the walls cracked, the floor sank, the windows
broke; sea-birds flew in and out, shrieking in the storm, until,
in 1826, one-half of the edifice tumbled into the sea, and the
other half followed in 1831. The chief portion of the village
stands on and near the cliff, but as the waste appears to be
greater there than elsewhere, houses are abandoned year by
year. In 1847, the <i>Blue Bell Inn</i> was five hundred and
thirty-four yards from the shore; of this quantity forty-three
yards were lost in the next six years. Kilnsea exists, therefore,
only as a diminished and diminishing parish, and in the
few scattered cottages near the bank of the Humber. The
old font was carried away from the church to Skeffling, where
it is preserved in the garden of the parsonage.</p>

<p>Her reminiscences ended, the good woman talked of the
rough walking that lay before me. It was a wild place out
there, not often visited by strangers; but sometimes &#x201c;wagon
loads o&#x2019; coontra foak cam&#x2019; to see t&#x2019; loights.&#x201d; At one time,
as I have heard, a stage-coach used to do the journey for the
gratification of the curious.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond the <i>Crown and Anchor</i> stands a
small lone cottage built of sea-cobbles, with a sandy garden
and potato-plot in front, and a sandy field, in which a thin,
stunted crop of rye was making believe to grow. Once past
this cottage, and all is a wild waste of sand, covered here
and there with reedy grass, among which you now and then
see a dusty pink convolvulus, struggling, as it were, to keep
alive a speck of beauty amid the barrenness. Here, as old
chronicles tell, the king once had &#x2018;coningers,&#x2019; or rabbit-warrens,
and rabbits still burrow in the hillocks. Presently,
there is the wide open sea on your left, and you can mark the
waves rushing up on either side, hissing and thundering
against the low bank that keeps them apart.</p>

<p>&#x201c;A broad long sand in the shape of a spoon,&#x201d; is the description
given of Spurn in a petition presented to parliament
nearly two hundred years ago; and, if we suppose the spoon
turned upside down, it still answers. It narrows and sinks as
it projects from the main shore for about two miles, and this
part being the weakest and most easily shifted by the rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
currents, is strengthened every few yards by rows of stakes
driven deeply in, and hurdle work. You see the effect in
the smooth drifts accumulated in the space between the barriers,
which only require to be planted with grass to become fixed.
As it is, the walking is laborious: you sink ankle-deep and
slide back at every step, unless you accept the alternative of
walking within the wash of the advancing wave. For a long
while the lighthouse appears to be as far off as ever.</p>

<p>A little farther, and we are on a rugged embankment of
chalk: the ground is low on each side, and a large pond rests
in the hollow between us and the sea on the left, marking the
spot where, a few years ago, the sea broke through and made
a clean sweep all across the bank. Every tide washed it
wider and deeper, until at last the fishing-vessels used it as a
short cut in entering or departing from the river. The effect
of the breach would, in time, had a low-water channel been
established, have seriously endangered the shore of the estuary,
besides threatening destruction to the site of the lighthouse.
As speedily, therefore, as wind and weather would permit,
piles and stakes were driven in, and the gap was filled up
with big lumps of chalk brought from the quarry at Barton,
forming an embankment sloped on both sides, to render the
shock of the waves as harmless as possible. The trucks, rails,
and sleepers with which the work had been accomplished
were still lying on the sand, awaiting removal. Henceforth
measures of precaution will be taken in time, for a conservator
of the river has been appointed.</p>

<p>The depth of the bay formed by the spoon appears to
increase more and more each time you look back. How vast
is the curve between this bank of chalk and the point where
we struck the shore from Skeffling! The far-spreading sands&mdash;or
rather mud&mdash;are known as the Trinity Dry Sands. At
this moment they are disappearing beneath the rising tide,
and you can easily see what thousands of acres might be
reclaimed were a barrier erected to keep out the water.
&#x201c;Government have been talkin&#x2019; o&#x2019; doing it for years,&#x201d; said a
fisherman to whom I talked at Kilnsea, &#x201c;but &#x2019;taint begun
yet.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Desolate as is now the scene, it was once enlivened by the
dwellings of men and the stir of commerce. Off the spot
where we stand, there lay, five hundred years ago, a low
islet, accessible by a flat ridge of sand and yellow pebbles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
known as Ravenser Odd, or Ravensrode, as some write it.
&#x201c;Situate at the entry to the sea,&#x201d; it was a port regarded with
envy and fear by the merchants of Grimsby and Hull, for its
pilots were skilful, and its traders enterprising. For a time
it flourished; but while the rival Roses wasted the realm, the
sea crept nearer, and at length, after an existence of a century
and a half, distinctly traceable in ancient records and old
books, a high tide, enraged by a storm, ended the history of
Ravenser Odd with a fearful catastrophe. A gravelly bank,
running outwards, still discoverable by excavation, is believed
to be the foundation of the low, flat ridge of sand and yellow
pebbles along which the folk of the little town passed daily
to and fro; among them at times strange seamen and merchants
from far-away lands, and cowled monks and friars
pacing meekly on errands of the Church.</p>

<p>And yonder, near the bottom of the curve, stood the town
variously described as Ravenser, Ravenspurne, and Ravenspurg&mdash;a
town that sent members to parliament in the
reigns of the first two Edwards, and was considered of sufficient
importance to be invited to take part in the great councils
held in London, when the &#x201c;kinge&#x2019;s majestie&#x201d; desired to
know the naval forces of the kingdom. Now, twice a day,
the tide rolls in triumphantly over its site.</p>

here:</p>

</div></div>

<p>The cross set up to commemorate the landing was shifted
from place to place when endangered by the sea, and lastly to
Hedon, where it still remains, as already mentioned. It was
at the same port that Edward IV. landed, with an excuse
plausible as that of the duke whose exploit he imitated.</p>

<p>Though it be &#x201c;naked&#x201d; still, and toilsome to walk on, the
shore is by no means barren of interest. By-and-by we come
to firm ground, mostly covered with thickly-matted grass; a
great irregular, oval mound, which represents the bowl of the
spoon reversed. Near its centre is a fenced garden and a row
of cottages&mdash;the residence of the life-boat crew. A little farther,
on the summit of the ridge, stands the lighthouse, built
by Smeaton, in 1776, and at the water&#x2019;s edge, on the inner
side, the lower light. The principal tower is ninety feet in
height, and from the gallery at the top you get an excellent
bird&#x2019;s-eye view over sea and land. Most remarkable is the
tongue of sand along which we have walked, now visible in
its whole extent and outline. It is lowest where the breach
was made, and now that the tide has risen higher, the chalk
embankment seems scarcely above the level of the water.
Beyond that it broadens away to the shore of the estuary on
one side, and the coast of Holderness on the other&mdash;low,
sweeping lines which your eye follows for miles. By the
waste of that coast the Spurn is maintained, and the Trinity
Sands are daily enlarged, and the meadows fattened along Ouse
and Trent. First the lighter particles of the falling cliffs
drift round by the set of the current, and gradually the
heavier portions and pebbles follow, and the supply being
inexhaustible, a phenomenon is produced similar to that of
the Chesil Bank, on the coast of Dorsetshire, except that here
the pebbles are for the most part masked by sand.</p>

<p>I looked northwards for Flamborough Head, but Dimlington
Hill, which lies between, though not half the height,
hides it completely. Beyond Dimlington lies Withernsea, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
small watering-place, the terminus of the Hull and Holderness
Railway, to which the natives of the melancholy town
betake themselves for health and recreation, tempted by a
quadrille band and cheap season-tickets. Adjoining Withernsea
is all that remains of Owthorne, a village which has
shared the doom of Kilnsea. The churches at the two places
were known as &#x2018;sister churches;&#x2019; that at Withernsea yet
stands in ruins; but Owthorne church was swept into the sea
within the memory of persons now living. The story runs
that two sisters living there, each on her manor, in the good
old times, began to build a church for the glory of God and
the good of their own souls, and the work went on prosperously
until a quarrel arose between them on the question
of spire or tower. Neither would yield. At length a holy monk
suggested that each sister should build a church on her own
manor; the suggestion was approved, and for long years the
Sister Churches resounded with the voice of prayer and
praise, and offered a fair day-mark to the mariner.</p>

<p>But, as of old, the devouring sea rushed higher and higher
upon the land, and the cliff, sapped and undermined, fell, and
with it the church of Owthorne. In 1786, the edge of the
burial-ground first began to fail; the church itself was not
touched till thirty years later. It was a mournful sight to
see the riven churchyard, and skeletons and broken coffins
sticking out from the new cliff, and bones, skulls, and fragments
of long-buried wood strewn on the beach. One of the
coffins washed out from a vault under the east end of the
church contained an embalmed corpse, the back of the scalp
still bearing the gray hairs of one who had been the village
pastor. The eyes of the villagers were shocked by these
ghastly relics of mortality tossed rudely forth to the light of
day; and aged folk who tottered down to see the havoc, wept
as by some remembered token they recognised a relative or
friend of bygone years, whom they had followed to the
grave&mdash;the resting place of the dead, as they trusted, till the end
of time. In some places bodies still clad in naval attire,
with bright-coloured silk kerchiefs round the neck, were unearthed,
as if the sea were eager to reclaim the shipwrecked
sailors whom it had in former time flung dead upon the
shore.</p>

<p>But, to return to the lighthouse. According to Smeaton&#x2019;s
survey this extremity of the spoon comprehends ninety-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
acres. It slopes gently to the sea, and is somewhat altered in
outline by every gale. At the time of my visit, rows of
piles were being driven in, and barriers of chalk erected, to
secure the ground on the outer side between the tower and
the sea; and a new row of cottages for the life-boat crew,
built nearer to the side where most wrecks occur than the
old row, was nearly finished. Beyond, towards the point,
stands a public-house, in what seems a dangerous situation,
close to the water. There was once a garden between it and
the sea; now the spray dashes into the rear of the house; for
the wall and one-half of the hindermost room have disappeared
along with the garden, and the hostess contents herself
with the rooms in front, fondly hoping they will last her
time. She has but few guests now, and talks with regret of
the change since the digging of ballast was forbidden on the
Spurn. Then trade was good, for the diggers were numerous
and thirsty. That ballast-digging should ever have been permitted
in so unstable a spot argues a great want of forethought
somewhere.</p>

<p>The paved enclosure around the tower is kept scrupulously
clean, for the rain which falls thereon and flows into the
cistern beneath is the only drinkable water to be had. &#x201c;It
never fails,&#x201d; said the keeper, &#x201c;but in some seasons acquires a
stale flavour.&#x201d; He was formerly at Flamborough, and although
appointment to the Spurn was promotion, he did not
like it so well. It was so lonesome; the rough, trackless
way between, made the nearest village seem far off; now and
then a boat came across with visitors from Cleathorpes, a
seven miles&#x2019; trip; there had been one that morning, but not
often enough to break the monotony. And he could not get
much diversion in reading, for the Trinity Board, he knew
not why, had ceased to circulate the lighthouse library.</p>

<p>The lesser tower stands at the foot of the inner slope, where
its base is covered by every tide. Its height is fifty feet, and
the entrance, approached by a long wooden bridge, is far
above reach of the water. This is the third tower erected on
the same spot; the two which preceded it suffered so much
damage from the sea that they had to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>About the time that ambitious Bolingbroke landed, a good
hermit, moved with pity by the number of wrecks, and the
dangers that beset the mouth of the estuary, set up a light
somewhere near Ravenser. But finding himself too poor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
maintain it, he addressed a petition to the &#x201c;wyse Commons
of Parliament,&#x201d; for succour, and not in vain. The mayor of
Hull, with other citizens, were empowered &#x201c;to make a toure
to be up on daylight and a redy bekyn wheryn shall be light
gevyng by nyght to alle the vesselx that comyn into the seid
ryver of Humbre.&#x201d;</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, Mr. Justinian Angell, of London,
obtained a license to build a lighthouse on the Spurn.
It was an octagonal tower of brick, displaying an open coal
fire on the top, which in stormy weather was frequently
blown quite out, when most wanted. Wrecks were continually
taking place; and it is only since Smeaton completed
his tower, and the floating-light was established in the offing,
and the channel was properly buoyed, that vessels can approach
the Humber with safety by night as well as by day.</p>

<p>It was full tide when I returned along the chalky embankment,
and the light spray from the breakers sprinkled my
cheek, giving me a playful intimation of what might be expected
in a storm.</p>

<p>I was passing a tilery near Welwick, when a beery fellow,
who sat in the little office with a jug before him and a pipe in
his mouth, threw up the window and asked, in a gruff, insolent
tone, &#x201c;A say, guvner, did ye meet Father Mathew?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;What did he say to ye?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;He told me I should see a fool at the tileworks.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Down went the window with a hearty slam, and before I
was fifty yards away, the same voice rushed into the road and
challenged me to go back and fight. And when the owner of
the voice saw that the stranger took no heed thereof, he cried,
till hidden by a bend in the road, &#x201c;Yer nothin&#x2019; but t&#x2019; scram
o&#x2019; t&#x2019; yerth!&mdash;yer nothin&#x2019; but t&#x2019; scram o&#x2019; t&#x2019; yerth!&#x201d;</p>

<p>Thinking <i>scram</i> might be the Yorkshire for <i>scum</i>, I made
a note of it for the benefit of philologists, and kept on to
Patrington, where I arrived in time for the last train to Hull,
quite content with six-and-twenty miles for my first day&#x2019;s
walk.</p>

<p>Journeying from Hull to Beverley by &#x2018;market-train&#x2019; on the
morrow, I had ample proof, in the noisy talk of the crowded
passengers, that Yorkshire dialect and its peculiar idioms are
not &#x201c;rapidly disappearing before the facilities for travel
afforded by railways.&#x201d; Nor could I fail to notice what has
before struck me, that taken class for class, the people north
of Coventry exhibit a rudeness, not to say coarseness of manners,
which is rarely seen south of that ancient city. In
Staffordshire, within twenty miles of Birmingham, there
are districts where baptism, marriage, and other moral and
religious observances considered as essentials of Christianity,
are as completely disregarded as among the heathen. In some
parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire similar characteristics
prevail; but rude manners do not necessarily imply loose
morality. Generally speaking the rudeness is a safety-valve
that lets off the faults or seeming faults of character; and I
for one prefer rudeness to that over-refinement prevalent in
Middlesex, where you may not call things by their right
names, and where, as a consequence, the sense of what is
fraudulent, and criminal, and wicked, has become weakened,
because of the very mild and innocent words in which &#x2018;good
society&#x2019; requires that dishonesty and sin should be spoken of.</p>

<p>If we alight at Cottingham and take a walk in the neighbourhood
we may discover the scene of a romantic incident.
There stood Baynard Castle, a grand old feudal structure, the
residence of Lord Wake. When Henry VIII. lay at Hull,
he sent a messenger to announce a royal visit to the castle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
anticipating, no doubt, a loyal reception; but the lord instead
of pride felt only alarm, for his wife, whom he loved truly,
was very beautiful, and he feared for the consequences should
the amorous monarch set eyes on her beauty. He resolved on
a stratagem: gave instructions to his confidential steward;
departed at dead of night with his wife; and before morning
nothing of the castle remained but a heap of smoking ruins.
The king, on hearing of the fire, little suspecting the cause,
generously sent a gift of two thousand pounds, with friendly
words, to mitigate the loss; but the wary lord having evaded
the visit, refused also to receive the money. And now, after
lapse of centuries, there is nothing left but traces of a moat
and rampart, to show the wayfarer where such an ardent
sacrifice was made to true affection.</p>

<p>Even among the farmers, at whose table I took breakfast at
the <i>Holderness Hotel</i>, at Beverley, there was evidence that
broad Yorkshire is not bad Dutch, as the proverb says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Gooid brade, botter, and cheese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is gooid Yorkshire, and gooid Friese.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The farmers talked about horses, and, to my surprise, they ate
but daintily of the good things, the beef, ham, mutton, brawn,
and other substantial fare that literally burdened the table.
Not one played the part of a good trencherman, but trifled as
if the victim of dinners fashionably late; and still more to
my surprise, when the conversation took a turn, they all spoke
disdainfully of walking. That sort of exercise was not at all
to their liking. &#x201c;I ha&#x2019;n&#x2019;t walked four mile I don&#x2019;t know
when,&#x201d; said one; and his fellows avowed themselves similarly
lazy. My intention to walk along the coast to the mouth of
the Tees appeared to them a weakminded project.</p>

<p>Beverley has a staid, respectable aspect, as if aware of its
claims to consideration. Many of the houses have an old-world
look, and among them a searching eye will discover
unmistakable bits of antiquity. A small columnar building
in the market-place is called the market-cross; beyond it
stands a rare old specimen of architecture, St. Mary&#x2019;s church,
the scene of the accident recorded by the ancient rhymer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;At Beverley a sudden chaunce did falle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The parish chirche stepille it fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At evynsonge tyme, the chaunce was thralle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ffourscore folke ther was slayn thay telle.&#x201d;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Beyond the church, one of the old town gates, a heavy stone
arch, bestrides the street. At the other end of the town,
screened by an ancient brick wall, you may see the house of the
Black Friars&mdash;more venerable than picturesque&mdash;besides little
glimpses of the middle ages on your straggling saunter thither.
Among these are not a few of that sort of endowments which
give occasion for abuses, and perpetuate helplessness. And of
noticeable peculiarities you will perhaps think that one might
be beneficially imitated in other towns. <span class="smcap">A Constable Lives
Here</span> is a notification which you may read on sundry little
boards, topped by a royal crown, nailed here and there over
the doors.</p>

<p>But the minster is the great attraction, rich in historical
associations and architectural beauty. The edifice, as it now
appears, has all been built since the destruction by fire, in
1138, of an older church that stood on the same spot. The
style is diverse, a not uncommon characteristic of ancient
churches: Early English at the east end, Decorated in the
nave, and Perpendicular in the west front and some minor
portions. This western front is considered the master-work,
for not one of its features is out of harmony with the others&mdash;a
specimen of the Perpendicular, so Rickman signifies, not
less admirable than the west front of York Minster of the
Decorated. The effect, indeed, is singularly striking as you
approach it from a quiet back street. I found a seat in
a favourable point of view, and sat till my eye was satisfied
with the sight of graceful forms, multiplied carvings, the
tracery and ornament from base to roof, and upwards, where
the towers, two hundred feet in height, rise grandly against
the bright blue sky.</p>

<p>However much you may admire yellow ochre on door-steps,
door-posts, and in the passages and on the stairs of dwelling-houses,
you will think it out of place when used to hide the
natural colour of the masonry in a noble church. For me,
the effect of the interior was marred by the yellow mask of
the great pillars. The eye expects repose and harmony, and
finds itself cheated. Apart from this, the lofty proportions,
the perspective of the aisles, the soaring arches, the streaming
lights and tinted shadows, fail not in their power to charm.
Your architect is a mighty magician. All the windows, as is
believed, were once filled with stained glass, for the large east
window was glazed in 1733 with the numerous fragments that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
remained after the destroyers of ecclesiastical art had perpetrated
their mischief. The colours show the true old tone;
and the effect, after all, is not unpleasing.</p>

<p>The Percy shrine on the north side of the choir is one of
the monuments to which, after viewing the carved stalls and
the altar screen, the sexton will call your special attention. It
is a canopied tomb of exquisite workmanship, enriched with
various carvings, figures of knights and angels, crockets and
finials; marking the resting-place, as is supposed, of the Lady
Idonea Clifford, wife of the second Lord Percy of Alnwick.
The Percys played a conspicuous part in Yorkshire history.
Another of the family, grandson of Hotspur, reposes, as is said,
under a tomb in the north transept. He was not a warrior,
but a prebend of Beverley. Then, at the east end, the Percy
chapel, which has lost its beauty through mutilation, commemorates
Henry, the fourth Earl of Northumberland, who
was massacred at his seat, Maiden Bower, near Topcliffe, in
1489. Authorized by Henry VII. to answer the appeal of the
leading men of his neighbourhood against a tax which levied
one-tenth of their property, by a declaration that not one
penny would be abated, he delivered his message in terms so
haughty and imperious, that the chiefs losing patience,
brought up their retainers, sacked the house and murdered
the earl. The corpse was buried here in the minster; and the
funeral, which cost a sum equivalent to 10,000<i>l.</i> present value,
is described as of surpassing magnificence. Among the
numerous items set down in the bill of charges is twopence a
piece for fourteen thousand &#x201c;pore folk&#x201d; at the burial.</p>

<p>In the south aisle of the nave stands another canopied
tomb, an altar tomb of elegant form, covered by a slab of
Purbeck marble, which appears never to have had a word of
inscription to tell in whose memory it was erected. Neither
trace nor record: nothing but tradition, and Venerable Bede.
St. John of Beverley had only to send a cruse of water into
which he had dipped his finger to a sick person to effect a
cure. He once restored the wife of Earl Puch, who lived at
Bishop Burton, a few miles distant. The lady drank a draught
of holy water, and recovered forthwith from a grievous sickness.
She had two daughters who, overawed by the miracle,
entered the nunnery at Beverley, where they won a reputation
for holiness and good works. It was they who gave the two
pastures on which freemen of the town still graze their cattle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
The rest of their story is told in the ballad: it was Christmas-eve,
says the rhymer, the customary service had been
performed in the chapel; the abbess and her nuns slowly
retired to pursue their devotions apart in their cells, all save
two, who lingered and went forth hand in hand after the
others. Whither went they? On the morrow they were
missing; and</p>

<span class="i2">And holy angels seen.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A miracle! cries the rhymer; and he goes on to tell how
that the nuns repair to the chapel and chant a hymn of
praise, after which the two sisters, kneeling, entreat the abbess
for her blessing, and no sooner has she pronounced <i>Vade in
pace</i>, than drooping like two fair lilies, two pale corpses sink to
the floor. Then the bells break into a chime wondrously
sweet, rung by no earthly hand; and when the sisters are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
laid in the tomb, they suffer no decay. Years passed away,
and still no change touched those lovely forms and angelic
features:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;And pilgrims came from all the land,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And St. John of Beverley.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another noteworthy object is King Athelstan&#x2019;s <i>Fridstool</i>,
or chair of peace; the centre of a sanctuary which extended
a mile from the minster in all directions. Any fugitive who
could once sit therein was safe, whatever his crime. When
Richard II. encamped at Beverley, on his way to Scotland,
his half-brother, Sir John Holland, having aided in the atrocious
murder of Lord Ralph Stafford, fled to the <i>Fridstool</i>,
nor would he leave it until assured of the king&#x2019;s pardon.
&#x201c;The Countess of Warwick is now out of Beverley sanctuary,&#x201d;
says Sir John Paston, writing to his brother in June, 1473&mdash;the
days of Edward IV. The chair, hewn from a single
block of stone, is very primitive in form and appearance; and
as devoid of beauty as some of the seats in the Soulages
collection. Athelstan was a great benefactor to the church.
You may see his effigy, and that of St. John, at the entrance
to the choir and over a door in the south transept, where
he is represented as handing a charter to the holy man,
of which one of the privileges is recorded in old English
characters:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza blackletter">
<span class="i0">Als Fre make I The<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As hert may thynke or Egh may see.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such a generous giver deserved to be held in honour,
especially if the eye were to see from the height of the tower,
to the top of which I now mounted by the narrow winding-stair.
While stopping to take breath in the belfry, you will
perhaps be amused by a table of ringer&#x2019;s laws, and a record of
marvellous peals, the same in purport as those exhibited at
Hull. You can take your time in the ascent, for sextons
eschew climbing, at least in all the churches I visited in
Yorkshire.</p>

Charter.</p>

<p>&#x201c;On my first coming to England I landed at Hull, whose
scenery enraptured me. The extended flatness of surface&mdash;the
tall trees loaded with foliage&mdash;the large fat cattle wading
to the knees in rich pasture&mdash;all had the appearance of fairy-land
fertility. I hastened to the top of the first steeple&mdash;thence
to the summit of Beverley Minster, and wondered
over the plain of verdure and rank luxury, without a heathy
hill or barren rock, which lay before me. When, after being
duly sated into dulness by the constant sight of this miserably
flat country, I saw my old bare mountains again, my ravished
mind struggled as if it would break through the prison of the
body, and soar with the eagle to the summit of the Grampians.
The Pentland, Lomond, and Ochil hills seemed to have
grown to an amazing size in my absence, and I remarked
several peculiarities about them which I had never observed
before.&#x201d;</p>

<p>This passage occurs in the writings of the late James
Gilchrist, an author to whom I am indebted for some part of my
mental culture. I quote it as an example of the different mood
of mind in which the view from the top of the tower may be
regarded. To one fresh from a town it is delightful. As you
step on the leads and gaze around on what was once called
&#x201c;the Lowths,&#x201d; you are surprised by the apparently boundless
expanse&mdash;a great champaign of verdure, far as eye can reach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
except where, in the north-west, the wolds begin to upheave
their purple undulations. The distance is forest-like: nearer
the woods stand out as groves, belts, and clumps, with park-like
openings between, and everywhere fields and hedgerows
innumerable. How your eye feasts on the uninterrupted
greenness, and follows the gleaming lines of road running off
in all directions, and comes back at last to survey the town
at the foot of the tower!</p>

<p>Few towns will bear inspection from above so well as
Beverley. It is well built, and is as clean in the rear of the
houses as in the streets. Looking from such a height, the
yards and gardens appear diminished, and the trim flower-beds,
and leafy arbours, and pebbled paths, and angular plots, and
a prevailing neatness reveal much in favour of the domestic
virtues of the inhabitants. And the effect is heightened by
the green spaces among the bright red roofs, and woods which
straggle in patches into the town, whereby it retains somewhat
of the sylvan aspect for which it was in former times
especially remarkable.</p>

<p>Apart from its natural features, the region is rich in associations.
The history of Beverley, an epitome of that of the
whole county, tempts one to linger, if but for half an hour.
It will not be time thrown away, for a glimpse of the past
may beneficially influence our further wanderings.</p>

<p>Here the territory of the Brigantes, which even the Romans
did not conquer till more than a hundred years after their
landing in Kent, stretched across the island from sea to sea.
Here, deep in the great forest, the Druids had one of their
sacred groves, a temple of living oaks, for their mysterious
worship and ruthless sacrifices. Hundreds of tumuli scattered
over the country, entombing kysts, coffins, fragments of skeletons,
and rude pottery, and not less the names of streets and
places, supply interesting testimony of their existence. Drewton,
a neighbouring village, marks, as is said, the site of Druid&#x2019;s-town,
where a stone about twelve feet in height yet standing
was so much venerated by the natives, that Augustine stood
upon it to preach, and erected a cross thereupon that the worshipper
might learn to associate it with a purer faith. It is
still known as Austin&#x2019;s Stone.</p>

<p>The Saxon followed, and finding the territory hollow between
the cliffs of the coast and the wolds, named it Höll-deira-ness,
whence the present Holderness. It was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
forest of Deira that the conference was held in presence of
Edwin and Ethelburga, between the missionary Paulinus and
Coifi, the high-priest of Odin, on the contending claims of
Christianity and Paganism. The right prevailed; and Coifi,
convinced by the arguments he had heard, seized a spear, and
hurrying on horseback to the temple at Godmanham, cursed
his deity, and hurled the spear at the image with such
fury that it remained quivering in the wall of the sacred
edifice. The multitude looked on in amazement, waiting for
some sign of high displeasure at so outrageous a desecration.
But no sign was given, and veering suddenly from dread to
derision, they tore down the temple, and destroyed the sacred
emblems. Edwin&#x2019;s timorous convictions were strengthened
by the result, and so great was the throng of converts to the
new faith, that, as is recorded, Paulinus baptized more than
ten thousand in one day in the Swale. According to tradition,
the present church at Godmanham, nine miles distant, a very
ancient edifice, was built from the ruins of the Pagan temple.</p>

<p>St. John of Beverley was born at Harpham, a village near
Driffield&mdash;Deirafeld&mdash;in 640. Diligent in his calling, and
eminently learned and conscientious, he became Archbishop of
York. In 700 he founded here an establishment of monks,
canons, and nuns, and rebuilt or beautified the church, which
had been erected in the second century; and when, after
thirty-three years of godly rule over his diocese, he laid aside
the burden of authority, it was to the peaceful cloisters of
Beverley that he retired. &#x201c;He was educated,&#x201d; says Fuller,
&#x201c;under Theodorus the Grecian, and Archbishop of Canterbury,
yet was he not so famous for his teacher as for his scholar,
Venerable Bede, who wrote this John&#x2019;s life, which he hath so
spiced with miracles, that it is of the hottest for a discreet
man to digest into his belief.&#x201d; He died in 721, and was buried
in his favourite church, with a reputation for sanctity which
eventually secured him a place in the calendar.</p>

<p>Was it not to St. John of Beverley that Athelstan owed the
victory at Brunanburgh, which made him sole monarch of
Northumbria? The fame of the &#x201c;great battle&#x201d; remains,
while all knowledge of the site of Brunanburgh has utterly
perished, unless, as is argued in the Proceedings of the Literary
and Historical Society of Liverpool, it was fought near Burnley,
in Lancashire. It was celebrated alike in Anglo-Saxon
song and history. Greater carnage of people slain by the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of the sword, says the ancient chronicle, had never been seen
in this island, since Angles and Saxons, mighty war-smiths,
crossed the broad seas to Britain. Athelstan, in fulfilment of
his vow, laid up his sword at the shrine of St. John, and added
largely to the revenues and privileges of the church. A stone
cross, erected on each of the four roads, a mile from the
minster, marked the limits of the sanctuary which he conferred.
One of these yet remains, but in a sadly mutilated
condition.</p>

<p>When the Conqueror came and laid the country waste from
Humber to Tees, trampling it into a &#x201c;horrible wilderness,&#x201d;
he spared Beverley and the surrounding lands, yielding, as was
believed, to the miraculous influence of the patron saint. One
of his soldiers, who entered the town with hostile intent, became
suddenly paralysed, and smitten with incurable disease;
and a captain falling, by accident, as it seemed, from his horse,
his head was turned completely round by the shock. These
were warnings not to be disregarded; and Beverley remained
a scene of fertile beauty amid the desolation.</p>

<p>One of John&#x2019;s successors, Archbishop Thurstan, took pleasure
also in fondling Beverley. He cut the canal, a mile in
length, from the river Hull to the town: he gave to the inhabitants
a charter of incorporation conferring similar privileges
to those enjoyed by the citizens of York, whereby they
were free from all fines and dues in England and Normandy;
had the right to pontage&mdash;that is, a toll on all the barges and
boats that passed under a bridge, as well as on the vehicles over
it; and to worry debtors as rigorously as they chose, without
fear of retaliation. In these anti-church-rate days it is surprising
enough to read of the power exercised by an archbishop
in the twelfth century. Thurstan had rule over the baronies
of Beverley and five other places, with power to try and
execute criminals, and punish thieves without appeal. In all
the baronies the prisons were his; to him belonged the gibbet,
pillory, and cucking-stool in the towns; the assize of bread
and beer; waifs and wrecks of the sea; the right to &#x2018;prises&#x2019;
in the river Hull, diligently enforced by his watchful coroners;
besides park and free warren, and all his land released from
suit and service.</p>

<p>That taking of prises, by the way, was a standing cause of
quarrel between the burghers of Hull and Beverley. The
right to seize two casks of wine from every vessel of more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
twenty tons burthen that entered the river, one before, the
other behind the mast, was a grievance too much akin to robbery
to be borne with patience. The merchants, wise in their
generation, tried to save their casks by discharging the cargoes
into smaller vessels before entering the port; but the coroners
detected the evasion, and took their prises all the same.
Hence bitter quarrels; in which the Beverley ships, dropping
down the stream to pursue their voyage, were many times
barred out of the Humber by the men of Hull. Once, when
the archbishop appeared at the port to defend his right, the
mayor, losing temper, snatched the crosier from the dignitary&#x2019;s
hand, and, using it as a weapon, actually spilt blood with the
sacred instrument.</p>

<p>Never was the saint&#x2019;s influence more triumphantly felt
than when Thurstan&#x2019;s fiery eloquence roused the citizens of
York to march against David of Scotland. The Scottish king,
to support Maud&#x2019;s claim against Stephen, ravaged Northumbria
with such ferocious devastation, that it seemed but a
repetition of the Norman havoc, and provoked the Saxon part
of the population to join in repelling the invader. After
threatening York, David moved northwards, followed by the
Yorkshire army, which had rendezvoused at the castle of
Thirsk. To inspire their patriotism, a great pole, topped by
a crucifix, and hung with the standards of St. John of Beverley,
St. Peter of York, and St. Wilfred of Ripon, was
mounted on wheels, and placed where every eye could behold
it. The Scottish army was overtaken three miles beyond
Northallerton, on the 22nd of August, 1138. The king, seeing
the threefold standard from afar, inquires of a deserter
what it means; whereupon he replies, in the words of the
ballad:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;A mast of a ship it is so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All bedeck&#x2019;d with gold so gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on its top is a Holy Cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That shines as bright as day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Around it hang the holy banners<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of many a blessed saint:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">St Peter, and John of Beverley,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And St. Wilfrid there they paint.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The king begins to have misgivings, and rejoins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Oh! had I but yon Holy Rood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That there so bright doth show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not care for yon English host,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor the worst that they could do.&#x201d;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></div></div>

<p>But in vain: the Yorkshire blood was up, no quarter was
given, and ten thousand Scotchmen bit the dust. So complete
was the victory, that the oppressed Saxons boasted of it
as an indemnity for their former sufferings; and the Battle of
the Standard remains memorable among the greatest battles
of Yorkshire, and the Standard Hill among her historical places.</p>

<p>Was it not the same St. John who afterwards appeared in
full pontificals to Stephen, and warned him to stay his purpose
of building a castle at Beverley? and was it not again
his banner, saved from the fire when the town and minster
were burnt in 1186, which rendered Edward I. victorious in
his invasion of Scotland? Did not his tomb sweat blood on
that famous day of Agincourt, and the rumour thereof bring
Henry V. and his lovely Kate hither on a pilgrimage?</p>

<p>Then the chronicler tells us that one while the provost and
burgesses, resolving to enlarge and beautify the minster,
brought together the best workmen from all parts of England;
and later, that the corporation repaired the edifice with stones
taken from the neighbouring abbey of Watton. And so bitter
became the quarrels between Hull and Beverley, that some
of the chief men encouraged the insurrectionary movements
known as the <i>Rising of the North</i> and the <i>Pilgrimage of Grace</i>,
with no other purpose than to damage their rivals. The burgesses
of Beverley, not having the fear of the marshal before
their eyes, were accused of unfair trading: of keeping two
yard measures and two bushels: unlawfully long and big to
buy with&mdash;unlawfully short and small to sell with. And
when in process of time the trade of the town decayed, evil-minded
persons looked on the change as a judgment. At present
there is little of manufacture within it besides that of the
implements which have made the name of Crosskill familiar
to farmers.</p>

<p>Some old customs lingered here obstinately. The cucking-stool
was not abolished until 1750, which some think was a
hundred years too soon. Ducking-stool-lane preserves its
memory. And down to 1825, an annual match at football
was played on the Sunday before the races, to which there
gathered all the rabble of the town and adjacent villages,
who for some years successfully resisted the putting down of
what had become a nuisance. Instead of abolishing the game,
it would have been better to change the day, and hold weekly
football matches on the race-course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>From the tower-top the eye takes in the site of Leckonfield,
where the Percys had a castle; of Watton Abbey, where
an English Abelard and Heloise mourned and suffered; of the
scanty remains of Meaux Abbey, founded about 1140, by
William le Gros, Earl of Albemarle. Concerning this nobleman,
we read that he had vowed a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, but grew so fat as to be detained at home against his
will. Feeling remorse, he consulted his confessor, who advised
him to establish a convent of Cistercians. A monk from
Fountains, eminent alike for piety and skill in architecture,
was invited to choose a site. He selected a park-like tract
commanding a view of the Humber. The earl, loving the
place, bade him reconsider his choice; but the monk, striking
his staff into the ground, replied, &#x201c;This place shall in future
be called the door of life, the vineyard of heaven, and shall
for ever be consecrated to religion and the service of God.&#x201d;
The abbey was built and tenanted by cowls from Fountains,
and flourished until floods and high tides wasted the lands,
and the Reformation destroyed the house.</p>

<p>But though one man may write a poem while &#x201c;waiting on
the bridge at Coventry,&#x201d; another may hardly, without presumption,
write a long chapter on the top of a tower. Let me
end, therefore, while descending, with a scrap of etymology.
Beaver lake, that is, the lake of floating islands, sacred to the
Druids, is said by one learned scribe to be the origin of the
name Beverley. Another finds it in the beavers that colonized
the river Hull, with lea for a suffix, and point to an ancient
seal, which represents St. John seated, resting his feet on a
beaver. Did not the wise men of Camelford set up the figure
of a camel on the top of their steeple, as a weathercock, because
their river winds very much, and camel is the aboriginal
British word for crooked? Other scholars trace Beverley
through Bevorlac, back to <i>Pedwarllech</i>&mdash;the four stones.</p>

<p>And here, by way of finish, are a few lines from Athelstan&#x2019;s
charter:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="hangindent small">The Great Drain&mdash;The Carrs&mdash;Submerged Forest&mdash;River Hull&mdash;Tickton&mdash;Routh&mdash;Tippling
Rustics&mdash;A Cooler for Combatants&mdash;The Blind Fiddler&mdash;The
Improvised Song&mdash;The Donkey Races&mdash;Specimens of Yorkshiremen&mdash;Good
Wages&mdash;A Peep at Cottage Life&mdash;Ways and Means&mdash;A Paragraph
for Bachelors&mdash;Hornsea Mere&mdash;The Abbots&#x2019; Duel&mdash;Hornsea Church&mdash;The
Marine Hotel.</p>

<p>About a mile from the town on the road to Hornsea, you
cross one of the great Holderness drains, broad and deep
enough for a canal, which, traversing the levels, falls into the
sea at Barmston. It crosses the hollow lands known as &#x2018;the
Carrs,&#x2019; once an insalubrious region of swamp and water
covering the remains of an ancient forest. So deep was the
water, that boats went from Beverley to Frothingham, and
some of the farmers found more profit in navigating to and fro
with smuggled merchandise concealed under loads of hay and
barley than in cultivating their farms. For years a large
swannery existed among the islands, and the &#x201c;king&#x2019;s
swanner&#x201d; used to come down and hold his periodical courts.
The number of submerged trees was almost incredible: pines
sixty feet in length, intermingled with yew, alder, and other
kinds, some standing as they grew, but the most leaning in
all directions, or lying flat. Six hundred trees were taken
from one field, and the labourers made good wages in digging
them out at twopence a piece. Some of the wood was so
sound that a speculator cut it up into walking sticks. Generally,
the upper layer consists of about two feet of peat, and
beneath this the trees were found densely packed to a depth
of twenty feet, and below these traces were met with in places
of a former surface: the bottom of the hollow formed by the
slope from the coast on one side, from the wolds on the other,
to which Holderness owes its name. The completion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
drainage works in 1835 produced a surprising change in the
landscape; green fields succeeded to stagnant water; and the
islands are now only discoverable by the &#x2018;holm&#x2019; which
terminates the name of some of the farms.</p>

<p>A little farther, and there is the river Hull, flowing clean
and cheerful to the muddy Humber. Then comes Tickton,
where, looking back from the swell in the road, you see a
good sylvan picture&mdash;the towers of the minster rising grand
and massy from what appears to be a great wood, backed by
the dark undulations of the wolds.</p>

<p>In the public-house at Routh, where I stayed to dine on
bread-and-cheese, the only fare procurable, I found a dozen
rustics anticipating their tippling hours with noisy revelry.
The one next whom I sat became immediately communicative
and confidential, and, telling me they had had to turn out a
quarrelsome companion, asked what was the best cure &#x201c;for a
lad as couldn&#x2019;t get a sup o&#x2019; ale without wanting to fight.&#x201d;
I replied, that a pail of cold water poured down the back was
a certain remedy; which so tickled his fancy that he rose and
made it known to the others, with uproarious applause. For
his own part he burst every minute into a wild laugh, repeating,
with a chuckle, &#x201c;A bucket o&#x2019; water!&#x201d;</p>

<p>There was one, however, of thoughtful and somewhat
melancholy countenance, who only smiled quietly, and sat
looking apparently on the floor. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter,
Massey?&#x201d; cried my neighbour.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Nought. He&#x2019;s a fool that&#x2019;s no melancholy yance a day,&#x201d;
came the reply, in the words of a Yorkshire proverb.</p>

<p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s you, Tom! Play us a tune, and I&#x2019;ll dance.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Some folk never get the cradle straws off their breech,&#x201d;
came the ready retort with another proverb.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Just like &#x2019;n,&#x201d; said the other to me. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the wittiest
man you ever see: always ready to answer, be &#x2019;t squire or t&#x2019;
parson, as soon as look at &#x2019;n. He gave a taste to Sir Clifford
hisself not long ago. He can make songs and sing &#x2019;em just
whenever he likes. I shouldn&#x2019;t wunner if he&#x2019;s making one
now. He&#x2019;s blind, ye see, and that makes &#x2019;n witty. We calls
&#x2019;n Massey, but his name&#x2019;s Mercer&mdash;Tom Mercer. Sing us a
song, Tom!&#x201d;</p>

<p>True enough. Nature having denied sight to him of the
melancholy visage, made it up with a rough and ready wit,
and ability to improvise a song apt to the occasion. He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
his fiddle from the bag and attempted to replace a broken
string; but the knot having slipped two or three times, three
or four of his companions offered their aid. The operation
was, however, too delicate for clumsy fingers swollen with
beer and rum, and as they all failed, I stepped forward, took
the fiddle in hand, and soon gave it back to the minstrel, who,
after a few preliminary flourishes, interrupted by cries of
&#x201c;Now for &#x2019;t!&#x201d; struck up a song. With a voice not unmusical,
rhythm good, and rhyme passable, he rattled out a
lively ditty on the incidents of the hour, introducing all his
acquaintances by name, and with stinging comments on their
peculiarities and weaknesses. The effect was heightened by
his own grave demeanour, and the fixed grim smile on his
face, while the others were kicking up their heels, and rolling
off their seats with frantic laughter.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t I tell ye so!&#x201d; broke in my neighbour, as he
winced a little under a shaft unusually keen from the singer&#x2019;s
quiver.</p>

<p>I was quite ready to praise the song, which, indeed, was
remarkable. The cleverest &#x2018;Ethiopian minstrel&#x2019; could not
chant his ditty more fluently than that blind fiddler caught up
all the telling points of the hour. He touched upon the one
who had been turned out, and on my hydropathic prescription,
and sundry circumstances which could only be understood by
one on the spot. Without pause or hesitation, he produced a
dozen stanzas, of which the last two may serve as a specimen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanzawide">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Rebecca sits a shellin&#x2019; peas, ye all may hear &#x2019;em pop:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knows who&#x2019;s comin&#x2019; with a cart: he won&#x2019;t forget to stop:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Frank, and Jem, and lazy Mat, got past the time to think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ginger-beer and rum have gone and muddled all their drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">With a fol lol, riddle, liddle, lol, lol, lol!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanzawide">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s a genelman fro&#x2019; Lunnon; &#x2019;tis well that he cam&#x2019; doun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he&#x2019;d no coom ye rantin&#x2019; lads would happen had no tune:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye fumbled at the fiddle-strings; he screwed &#x2019;em tight and strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Success to Lunnon then I say, and so here ends my song.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">With a fol lol, riddle, liddle, lol, lol, lol!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lusty acclamations and a drink from every man&#x2019;s jug
rewarded the fiddler, and a vigorous cry was set up for &#x201c;The
Donkey Races,&#x201d; another of his songs, which, as lazy Mat told
me, &#x201c;had been printed and sold by hundreds.&#x201d; The blind
man, nothing loth, rattled off a lively prelude, and sang his
song with telling effect. The race was supposed to be run by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
donkeys from all the towns and villages of the neighbourhood:
from Patrington, Hedon, Hull, Driffield, Beverley, and others,
each possessed of a certain local peculiarity, the mention of
which threw the company into ecstacies of merriment. And
when the &#x201c;donkey from York&#x201d; was introduced along with
his &#x201c;sire Gravelcart&#x201d; and his &#x201c;dam Work,&#x201d; two of the
guests flumped from their chairs to laugh more at ease on the
floor. The fiddler seemed to enjoy the effect of his music;
but his grim smile took no relief; the twinkle of the eye was
wanting. He was now sure of his game, for the afternoon at
least.</p>

<p>While looking round on the party, I had little difficulty in
discerning among them the three principal varieties of Yorkshiremen.
There was the tall, broad-shouldered rustic, whose
stalwart limbs, light gray or blue eyes, yellowish hair, and
open features indicate the Saxon; there was the Scandinavian,
less tall and big, with eyes, hair, and complexion dark, and
an intention in the expression not perceptible in the Saxon
face; and last, the Celt, short, swarthy, and Irish looking.
The first two appeared to me most numerous in the East and
North Ridings, the last in the West.</p>

<p>On the question of wages they were all content. Here and
there a man got eighteen shillings a week; but the general
rate was fifteen shillings, or &#x201c;nine shill&#x2019;n&#x2019;s a week and our
meat&#x201d; (diet), as one expressed it. Whatever folk might do
in the south, Yorkshire lads didn&#x2019;t mean to work for nothing,
or to put up with scanty food. &#x201c;We get beef and mutton to
eat,&#x201d; said lazy Mat, &#x201c;and plenty of it.&#x201d;</p>

<p>The road continues between fat fields and pastures, skirts a
park bordered by noble trees, or tall plantations, in which the
breeze lingers to play with the branches: here and there a
few cottages, or a hamlet, clean in-doors, and pretty out of
doors, with gay little flower-gardens. Frequent thunder-showers
fell, and I was glad to shelter from the heaviest under
a roof. Always the same cleanliness and signs of thrift, and
manifest pleasure in a brief talk with the stranger. And
always the same report about wages, and plenty of work for
men and boys; but a slowness to believe that sending a boy
to school would be better than keeping him at work for five
shillings a week. I got but few examples of reading, and
those far from promising, and could not help remembering
how different my experiences had been the year before in
Bohemia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the cottages in which I took shelter stands lonely in
a little wood. The tenant, a young labourer, who had just
come home from work, &#x201c;not a bit sorry,&#x201d; as he said, &#x201c;that
&#x2019;twas Saturday afternoon,&#x201d; entered willingly into conversation,
and made no secret of his circumstances. His testimony was
also favourable as regards wages. He earned fifteen shillings
a week, and didn&#x2019;t see any reason to complain of hard times,
for he paid but three pounds a year for his cottage, which sum
he recovered from his garden in vegetables and flowers, besides
sundry little advantages which at times fall to the lot of
rustics. He eat meat&mdash;beef or mutton&mdash;&#x201c;pretty well every
day,&#x201d; and was fully persuaded that without enough of good
food a man could not do a fair day&#x2019;s work.</p>

<p>While we talked his wife was putting the finishing touch to
the day&#x2019;s cleaning by washing the brick floor, and without
making herself unclean or untidy, as many do. Her husband
had shown himself no bad judge of rustic beauty when he
chose her as his helpmate, and her good looks were repeated in
their little daughter, who ran playfully about the room. I
suggested that the evening, when one wished to sit quiet and
comfortable, was hardly the time to wet the floor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d
rather see it wet than mucky&#x201d; (<i>mooky</i>, as he pronounced it),
was the answer; and neither husband nor wife was ready to
believe that the ill-health too plainly observable among many
cottagers&#x2019; children arises from avoidable damp. To wash the
floor in the morning, when no one had occasion to sit in the
room, would be against all rule.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Stay a bit longer,&#x201d; said the young man, as I rose when
the shower ceased; &#x201c;I like to hear ye talk.&#x201d;</p>

<p>And I liked to hear him talk, especially as he began to
praise his wife. It was such a pleasure to come home when
there was such a lass as that to make a man comfortable.
Nobody could beat her at making a shirt or making bread, or
cooking; and he opened the oven to show me how much room
there was for the loaves. Scarcely a cottage but has a grate
with iron oven attached, and in some places the overpowering
heat reminded me of my friend&#x2019;s house in Ulrichsthal. Then
we had a little discourse about books. He liked reading, and
had a Bible for Sundays, and a few odd volumes which he
read in the evenings, but not without difficulty; it was so
hard to keep awake after a day out of doors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I made enticing signs to the merry little lassie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and at last she sat without fear on my knee, and listened with
a happy smile and wondering eyes to my chant of the pastoral
legend of <i>Little Bopeep</i>. Such good friends did we become,
that when at length I said &#x201c;good-bye,&#x201d; and shook hands,
there was a general expression of regret, and a hope that I
would call again. I certainly will the next time I visit
Holderness.</p>

<p>Often since has this incident recurred to my mind, and
most often when the discussion was going on in the newspapers
concerning the impropriety of marriage on three
hundred a year. I wished that the writers, especially he who
sneered at domestic life, could go down into Yorkshire, and
see how much happiness may be had for less than fifty pounds
a year. As if any selfish bachelor enjoyments, any of the
talk of the clubs, were worth the prattle of infancy, the
happy voices of childhood, the pleasures and duties that come
with offspring! Sandeau deserved to be made <i>Académicien</i>, if
only for having said that &#x201c;un berceau est plus éloquent
qu&#x2019;une chaire, et rien n&#x2019;enseigne mieux à l&#x2019;homme les côtés
sérieux de sa destinée.&#x201d;</p>

<p>A mile or two farther and water gleams through the trees
on the right. It is Hornsea Mere, nearly two miles in length,
and soon, when the road skirts the margin, you see reedy
shallows, the resort of wild-fowl, and swans floating around
the wooded islands; and at the upper end the belts and
masses of trees under which the visitors to Hornsea find pleasant
walks while sauntering out to the sylvan scenery of
Wassand and Sigglesthorne. The lake, said a passing villager,
averages ten feet in depth, with perhaps as much more of
mud, and swarms with fish, chiefly pike and perch. He added
something about the great people of the neighbourhood, who
would not let a poor fellow fish in the mere, and ordered the
keeper to duck even little boys poaching with stick and string.
And he recited with a gruff chuckle a rhyming epitaph which
one of his neighbours had composed to the memory of a
clergyman who had made himself particularly obnoxious. It
did not flatter the deceased.</p>

<p>In Henry the Third&#x2019;s reign, as may be read in the <i>Liber
Melsæ</i>, or Chronicle of the Abbey of Meaux, the Abbot of St.
Mary&#x2019;s at York quarrelled with him of Meaux, about the right
to fish in the mere, and not being able to decide the quarrel
by argument, the pious churchmen had recourse to arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Each party hired combatants, who met on the appointed day,
and after a horse had been swum across the mere, and stakes
had been planted to mark the Abbot of St. Mary&#x2019;s claim, they
fought from morning until nightfall, and Meaux lost the
battle, and with it his ancient right of fishery.</p>

<p>In Elizabeth&#x2019;s reign, the Countess of Warwick granted to
Marmaduke Constable the right to fish and fowl for &#x201c;the
some of fyftye and five pounds of lawful English money.&#x201d;
This Marmaduke, who thus testified his love of fin and feather,
was an ancestor of Sir Clifford Constable, the present &#x201c;Lord
Paramount,&#x201d; upon whom the blind fiddler exercised his wit.</p>

<p>Hornsea church stands on an eminence at the eastern end
between the mere and the village. Its low square tower once
bore a tall spire, on which, as is said, the builder had cut an
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hornsea steeple, when I built thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou was 10 miles off Burlington,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten miles off Beverley, and 10 miles off sea;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but it fell during a gale in 1773. The edifice is a specimen
of fifteenth-century architecture, with portions of an earlier
date. The crypt under the chancel was at one time a receptacle
for smuggled goods, and the clerk was down there doing
unlawful work when the tempest smote the spire, and frightened
him well-nigh to death. The memory of the last rector
is preserved by an altar tomb of alabaster, and of William
Day, gentleman, who &#x201c;dyed&#x201d; in 1616, by a curious epitaph:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If that man&#x2019;s life be likened to a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One here interr&#x2019;d in youth did lose a day<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For why? Faith, Hope, and Christian Charity,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Hornsea village is a homely-looking place, with two or
three inns, a post-office, and little shops and houses furbished
up till they look expectant of customers and lodgers. Many
a pair of eyes took an observation of me as I passed along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
street, and away up the hill, seeking for quarters with an
open prospect. Half a mile farther, the ground always rising,
and you come to the edge of a clay cliff, and a row of modern
houses, and the <i>Marine Hotel</i> in full view of the sea.</p>

<p>Even at the first glance you note the waste of the land.
As at Kilnsea, so here. A few miles to the south, between
us and Owthorne, stands the village of Aldborough, far to the
rear of the site once occupied by its church. The sea washed
it away. That church was built by Ulf, a mighty thane, in
the reign of Canute. A stone, a relic of the former edifice,
bearing an inscription in Anglo-Saxon, which he caused to be
cut, is preserved in the wall of the present church. This
stone, and Ulf&#x2019;s horn, still to be seen in York Minster, are
among the most venerable antiquities of the county.</p>

<p>Hornsea is a favourite resort of many Yorkshire folk who
love quiet; hence a casual traveller is liable to be disappointed
of a lodging on the shore. There was, however, a room to
spare at the hotel&mdash;a top room, from which, later in the evening,
I saw miles of ripples twinkling with moonlight, and
heard their murmur on the sand through the open window
till I fell asleep.</p>

<p>I was out early the next morning for a stroll. The upper
margin of the beach, covered only by the highest tides, is
loose, heavy sand, strewn with hardened lumps of clay, fatiguing
to walk upon; but grows firmer as you approach the water.
The wheels of the bathing-machines have broad wooden tires
to prevent their sinking. The cliffs are, as we saw near the
Spurn, nothing but clay, very irregular in profile and elevation,
resembling, for the most part, a great brown bank, varying in
height from ten feet to forty. The hotel stands on a rise,
which overtops the land on each side and juts out farther,
commanding a view for miles, bounded on the north by that
far-stretching promontory, Flamborough Head; and to the
south by the pale line, where land and water meet the sky.
The morning sun touching the many jutting points, while the
intervals lay in thin, hazy shadow, imparted something picturesque
to the scene, which vanished as the hours drew on,
and the stronger light revealed the monotonous colour and unclothed
surface of the cliffs. Towards evening the picturesque
reappears with the lights falling in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>A short distance south of the hotel, a stream runs from the
mere to the sea. The land is low here, so low that unusually
high tides have forced their way up the channel of the stream
to the lake, and flooded the grounds on both sides; and the
effect will be, as Professor Phillips says, the entire drainage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of the mere, and production of phenomena similar to those
which may be seen on the other parts of the coast of Holderness:
a depression in the cliffs exposing a section of deposits
such as are only formed under a large surface of standing water.
The result is a mere question of time; and if it be true that
Hornsea church once stood ten miles from the sea, within the
historical period, the scant half-mile, which is now all that
separates it from the hungry waves, has no very lengthened
term of existence before it. More than a mile in breadth
along the whole coast from Bridlington to Spurn has been
devoured since the Battle of the Standard was fought.</p>

<p>An old man of eighty who lives in the village says there are
no such high tides now as when he was a boy; and if he be
not a romancer, the low ground from the sea to the mere
must, at least once, have presented the appearance of a great
lake. But the wasting process is carried on by other means
than the sea. I saw threads of water running down the cliffs,
produced by yesterday&#x2019;s rain, and not without astonishment
at the great quantities of mud they deposit at the base, forming
in places a narrow viscous stream, creeping in a raised channel
across the sand, or confused pasty heaps dotted with pools of
liquid ochre. Mr. Coniton, the proprietor of the hotel, told
me that he believed the rain had more influence than the sea
in causing the waste of land, and he showed me the means he
employed to protect his territory from one and the other. To
prevent the loss by rain, which he estimates, where no precautions
are taken, at a foot a year, he at first sloped his cliff
at such an angle that the water runs easily down and with
scarcely appreciable mischief. Then, to protect the base, he
has driven rows of piles through the sand into the clay
beneath, and these, checking the natural drift of the sand to
the southward, preserve the under stratum. Where no such
barrier exists, the waves in a winter storm sweep all the sand
clean off, and lay bare the clay, and tumbling upon it with
mighty shocks, sometimes wear it down a foot in the course
of a tide. By this lowering of the base, the saturated soil
above, deprived of support, topples over, leaving a huge gap,
which only facilitates further encroachments; and in the
course of a few tides the fallen mass is drifted away to enlarge
the shoals in the estuary of the Humber.</p>

<p>Mr. Coniton entered into possession fifteen years ago, and
in all that time, so effectual are the safeguards, has lost none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of his land. The edge, he says, has not receded, and, to show
what might be, he points to his neighbour&#x2019;s field, which has
shrunk away some yards to the rear.</p>

<p>The space between the hotel and the edge of the cliff is
laid out as a lawn, which, sheltered by a bank on the north,
forms an agreeable outlook and lounging-place, while gravelled
paths lead to an easy descent to the sands at each extremity
of the premises. The house is well arranged; there is no
noise, no slackness in the service; and families may live as
privately as in a private residence. The charge for adults is
four shillings a day; for young children, half a guinea a week,
without stint as to the number of meals: to which must be
added the cost of rooms and attendance. The charges to
casual guests are as reasonable as could be desired, contrasting
favourably in this particular with my experiences at Hull and
in certain of the inland towns and villages. Ninepence a day
for service and boots is charged in the bill; hence you can
depart without being troubled to &#x201c;remember&#x201d; anybody. An
omnibus arrives every day from Beverley during the season&mdash;May
to November. The distance is thirteen miles.</p>

<p>The falling tide had left a breadth of comparatively firm
sand by the time I was ready to start, and along that I took
my way to Bridlington: another stage of thirteen miles.
The morning was bounteous in elements of enjoyment: a
bright sun, great white clouds sailing high across the blue, a
south-westerly breeze, which made the sea playful and murmurous:
all gratifying to the desire of a wayfarer&#x2019;s heart. I
could not help pitying those farmers at Beverley, who saw no
pleasure in walking. No pleasure in the surest promotion of
health and exercise! No pleasure in the steady progressive
motion which satisfies our love of change without hindering
observation! No pleasure in walking, that strengthens the
limbs and invigorates the lungs! No pleasure in arming
the sling against the giant! No pleasure in the occasion of
cheerful thoughts and manifold suggestions which bring contentment
to the heart! Walking is an exercise which in our
days might replace, more commonly than it does, the rude
out-door recreations of former times; and if but a few of the
many hundreds who put on their Sunday clothes to lounge the
hours away at the corner of a street, would but take a ten
miles&#x2019; walk out to the country lanes or breezy moorlands, they
would find benefit alike to their manhood and morals. If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
remember rightly, it is one of the old Greeks who says that
walking will almost cure a bad conscience; and, for my part,
I am never so ready to obey the precept of neighbourly love
as when my sentiments are harmonized by walks of seven or
eight leagues a day.</p>

<p>The sands are of varying consistency. In some places you
leave deep footprints; and nowhere is the firmness equal to
that we shall find farther north, except on the wet border
from which the wave has just retired. Mile after mile it
stretches before you, a broad slope of sand, sparely roughened
here and there by pebble drifts. At times you see numerous
rounded lumps lying about of many sizes, which at a distance
resemble sleeping turtles, and on a nearer view prove to be
nothing but masses of hardened clay, water-worn, and as full
of pebbles as a canon&#x2019;s pudding is of plums. These are
portions of the bottoms of lakes overrun by the sea; stubborn
vestiges, which yield but slowly. At times the shortest route
takes you through watery flats, or broad shallow streams,
where little rivers are well-nigh swallowed by the sand as
they run across to the sea. A little farther and you come to
a low bank, everywhere cut up by glistening ripple-marks, or
to a bare patch of clay, which feels like india-rubber under
your foot.</p>

<p>And the cliffs taken thus furlong by furlong offer a greater
variety than appears at first sight. Here, the clay is cracked
in such a way as to resemble nothing so much as a pile of huge
brown loaves; now it falls away into a broken hollow patched
with rough grass; now it juts again so full of perpendicular
cracks that you liken it to a mass of starch; now it is grooved
by a deep gully; now a buttress terminates in a crumbling
pyramid&mdash;umber mottled with yellow; now it is a rude stair,
six great steps only to the summit; now a point, of which
you would say the extremity has been shaped by turf-cutters;
now a wall of pebbles, hundreds of thousands of all sizes, the
largest equal in bigness to a child&#x2019;s head; now a shattered
ruin fallen in a confused heap. Such are some of the appearances
left by the waves in their never-ending aggressions.</p>

<p>In one hollow the disposition of the clay was so singular,
and apparently artificial, and unlike anything which I had
ever seen, that I could only imagine it to be a recess in which
a party of Assyrian brickmakers had been at work and left
great piles of their bricks in different degrees of finish. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
was easier to imagine that than to believe such effects could
be produced by the dash of the sea.</p>

<p>The greatest elevation occurs about Atwick and Skirlington,
places interesting to the palæontologist, on account of fossils&mdash;an
elephant&#x2019;s tusk, and the head and horns of the great Irish
elk&mdash;found in the cliffs. Farther on the cliff sinks to a mere
bank, six feet in height, but, whether high or low, you need
not fear a surprise by the rising tide, for you can scramble up
anywhere out of reach of the water. Looking inland from
these points you see always the same character of scenery, and
where a path zigzags up you will notice large trays used for
carrying up the heaps of pebbles there accumulated, for the
construction of drains, fences, and walls. Among remarkable
curiosities are two large boulders&mdash;one of a slaty rock, the
other of granite half embedded in the sand. From what part
of the country were they drifted to their present position?</p>

<p>Here and there I fell in with a villager taking a quiet walk
on the beach, and leading two or three little children. One
of them told me that the Stricklands, a well-known family in
Holderness, derived their name from Strikeland; that is, they
were the first to <i>strike</i> the <i>land</i> when they came over.
Collectors of folk-lore will perhaps make a note of this rustic
etymology. He remembered hearing his father talk of the
alarm that prevailed all along the coast when there was talk
of &#x201c;Bonypart&#x2019;s&#x201d; invasion; and how that Paul Jones never
sailed past without firing a ball at Rolleston Hall, that stood
on a slope in sight of the sea, where dwelt Mr. Brough, who,
as Marshal to the Court of Admiralty, had to direct the proceedings
on the trial of Admiral Byng.</p>

<p>Here and there are parties of country lads bathing; or
trying which can take the longest jump on the smooth sand;
or squatting in soft places idly watching the waves, and
exasperating their dogs into a fight.</p>

<p>After passing Skipsea, and the northern end of the Barmston
drain, the lone house in the distance catches your eye; the
last house of Auburn, a village devoured by the sea. The
distance is deceptive along the level shore; but when at length
you come to the spot, you see a poor weather-beaten cottage
on the top of the cliff, and so close to the edge that the eastern
wall forms but one perpendicular line with the cliff itself.
You can hardly help fancying that it will fall at any moment,
even while you are looking; but so it has stood for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
years; a fact the more remarkable, as in this place the cliff
projects as if in defiance of the ruthless waters. Look at the
old maps, and you will read: &#x201c;Here Auburn washed away
by the sea;&#x201d; and the lone house remains a melancholy yet
suggestive monument of geological change.</p>

<p>Now Bridlington comes in sight, and immediately beyond you
see a change in the aspect of the cliffs. The chalk formation
which stretches across England from Hampshire to Yorkshire,
makes its appearance here as a thin white band under the
clay, becoming thicker and thicker, till at length the whole
cliff is chalk from base to summit, and the great promontory,
of snowy whiteness, gleams afar in the sunlight along the
shores and across the sea. The chalk opposes a barrier, which,
though far less stubborn than the volcanic rocks of Cornwall,
is yet more enduring than the clay: hence the land rushes
proudly out on the domain of ocean. Nearness, however,
while it shows you the mouths of caverns and gullies, like
dark shades in the chalk, markedly shortens the headland to
the eye.</p>

<p>The last mile of cliff, as you approach Bridlington is diversified
by a pale chalky stratum, about four feet thick along
the top. It dips down in places basin-like, and contrasts
strangely with the clay.</p>

<p>Bridlington Quay, as the seaward part of the town is
named, though situated at the very rear of the Head, is,
as I saw on turning the last point, not safe from the sap and
shock of the breakers. The cliff, sunken in places, exhibits
the effect of landslips in rough slopes and ugly heaps. Two
legs of the seat fixed at the corner overhang the edge and rest
upon nothing, and you see that the remainder are doomed to
follow, notwithstanding the numerous piles driven in for
protection.</p>

<p>The two arms of the pier enclose a small harbour, one of
the few places of refuge for vessels caught by easterly gales
on the Yorkshire coast&mdash;a coast deficient in good and easily-accessible
harbours. A chalybeate spring bursts from the cliff
on the northern side; and near the middle of the port an
artesian well throws up a constant stream, varying with the
rise and fall of the tide. The noisy brook which you cross,
on entering the principal street, has its sources in those
remarkable springs which, known as &#x2018;the Gipseys,&#x2019; gush
out from the foot of the wolds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Bridlington attracts numbers of that class of visitors for
whom Hornsea is too quiet and Scarborough too gay. In fine
weather, steamers arrive with pleasure parties from Hull and
Whitby, Flamborough Head being the great attraction. The
boatmen ask fifteen shillings a day for a boat to sail round the
Head, and give you opportunity to peer into caverns, or to
shoot seafowl should your desire be for &#x201c;sport.&#x201d; And besides
their pay, the tough old fellows like to have a voice in provisioning
the boat, resolute to demonstrate how much your
pleasure depends on &#x201c;laying in plenty of bottled porter.&#x201d;</p>

<p>The church, situate in the town about half a mile from the
Quay, was at one time as large and handsome as the minster
of Beverley; but of late years the visitor has only been able
to see the remains of beauty through grievous dilapidations,
in which the hand of man was more implicated than the
weather. Paul Jones is still held responsible for some of the
mischief. Now, however, the work of restoration is commenced,
and ere long the admirable details and proportions of
the edifice will reappear.</p>

<p>Here it was that, attended by a convoy of seven Dutch vessels
of war, commanded by Van Tromp, Queen Henrietta Maria
landed in 1643; and there are people yet living who remember
the terror inspired by the redoubtable privateer aforementioned,
while the North-American colonies were battling for
their liberties. On the 20th of September, 1779, a messenger
came in hot haste from Scarborough to Bridlington with
news that an enemy had been espied off the coast, and in the
evening of the same day the Yankee squadron was in sight
from Flamborough Head. Preparations were at once made to
send the women and children into the interior; money and
valuables were hastily packed, and some of the inhabitants,
panic-stricken, actually fled. The drum beat to arms; the
Northumberland militia, then quartered in the neighbourhood,
were called out; and all the coasting-vessels bore up for Bridlington
Bay, and crowded for protection into the little harbour.
Scarcely a town or village on the Yorkshire coast but has its
story of alarms and unwelcome visitations from the American
privateers.</p>

<p>On the 24th the timid population witnessed a sea-fight from
the cliffs. Jones, with the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>, and the <i>Pallas</i>
and <i>Alliance</i> frigates, intercepted the <i>Serapis</i>, of forty-four,
and <i>Countess of Scarbro&#x2019;</i>, of twenty-two guns, convoying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
fleet of merchant-vessels, and at once commenced action. The
two largest ships grappled, and fired into each other for two
hours, the two frigates meanwhile sailing round, and doing
their best to cripple the Englishman. The American at length
struck; but only as a feint, for when the crew of the <i>Serapis</i>
boarded, they fell into an ambush prepared for them, and suffered
so much loss, that the <i>Serapis</i> hauled down her colours,
and the <i>Countess of Scarbro&#x2019;</i> was taken by the <i>Pallas</i>. The
victory, however, was dearly won: the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>
lost three hundred men in killed and wounded, and was so
grievously cut up in her hull, that the next day she went to
the bottom. Captain Pearson, of the <i>Serapis</i>, in his despatch
to the Admiralty announcing the capture of his ship, had good
reason to write, &#x201c;I flatter myself with the hopes that their
lordships will be convinced that she has not been given
away.&#x201d;</p>

<p>The party&mdash;four gentlemen and one lady&mdash;at the boarding-house
where I tarried to dine, agreed unanimously that
to pass a whole Sunday morning in walking, was especially
blameworthy. Besides being wrong in itself, it was &#x201c;setting
such a bad example;&#x201d; nor would they hear reason on the
question. With them, indeed, it was no question: they
quoted the fourth commandment, and that settled it. Any
departure from that was decidedly wrong, if not sinful.
And then, perhaps out of a benevolent desire for my spiritual
welfare, they urged me to stay till the morrow, when
I might join them in a boat-trip to the Head and help to
fire guns at the seafowl. It surprised me somewhat to hear
them discuss their project with as much animation as if they
had not just administered a homily to me, or the day had
not been Sunday. The possibilities of weather, the merits
of cold pies, sandwiches, and lively bottled drinks, powder
and shot moreover, and tidal contingencies, were talked about
in a way that led me to infer there was nothing at all wrong
in consuming the holy day with anticipations of pleasure to
come in the days reckoned unholy. Then one of the party
set off to walk to a village three miles distant; and presently,
when I started for Flamborough, the other three accompanied
me as far as the path along the cliff was easy to the foot. So
I could only infer again that there is nothing wrong in
short walks on a Sunday. It is simply the distance that
constitutes the difference between good and evil. Some
folk appear to believe that if they only sit under a pulpit in
the morning, they have earned a dispensation for the rest of
the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The cliffs now are sixty feet in height, broken by frequent
slips in the upper stratum of clay, and numerous cracks running
along the path marks the limits of future falls. One of
the slips appeared to be but a few hours old, and the lumps,
of all dimensions, with patches of grass and weeds sticking out
here and there, lying in a great confused slope, suggested the
idea of an avalanche of clay. Ere long you come to Yarborough
House, a stately mansion standing embowered by trees about
a furlong from the shore. Holding that an Englishman has an
inherent right of way along the edge of his own country, I
gave no heed to the usual wooden warning to trespassers,
erected where the path strikes inland at the skirt of the
grounds, and kept along the pathless margin of the cliff. Nothing
appeared to be disturbed by my presence except a few
rabbits, that darted as if in terror to their burrows. Once
past the grounds you come into large fields, where the grain
grows so close to the brink of the precipice, that you wonder
alike at the thrift of the Yorkshire farmers, and the skill with
which they drive their ploughs in critical situations.</p>

<p>As you proceed, the cliffs rise higher, interrupted in places
by narrow gullies, one of which is so deep and the farther
bank so high as to appear truly formidable, and shut out all
prospect to the east. After a difficult scramble down, and a
more difficult scramble up, you find yourself on the top of a
ridge, which, stretching all across the base of the headland
from sea to sea, along the margin of a natural ravine, remains
a monument, miles in length, of the days</p>

<span class="i0">Triumphant through Northumbrian sky.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is the &#x201c;Dane&#x2019;s Dike,&#x201d; a barrier raised by our piratical
Scandinavian forefathers to protect their settlements on the
great promontory. With such a fence, they had always a refuge
to fall back upon where they could hold their own, and
command the landing-places till more ships and marauders
arrived with succours. As the eye follows the straight line of
the huge grass-grown embankment, you will feel something
like admiration of the resolute industry by which it was raised,
and perhaps think of the fierce battles which its now lonely
slopes must have once witnessed.</p>

<p>Still the cliffs ascend. Farther on I came to a broader and
deeper ravine, at the mouth of which a few boats lay moored;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and others hauled up on the beach, and coming nearer, I saw
boat after boat lodged here and there on the slopes, even to
the level ground above, where, judging from the number, the
fleet found its rendezvous. It was curious to see so many
keels out of their element, most of them gay with stripes of
blue and red, and bearing the names of the wives and
daughters of <i>Flambro&#x2019;</i>. The little bay, however, known as
the South Landing, is one of the two ports of Flamborough:
the other, as we shall see after passing the lighthouse, is similar
in formation&mdash;a mere gap in the cliffs. They might be
called providential landing-places, for without them the fishermen
of Flamborough would have no access to the sea, except
by ladders down the precipice. As it is, the declivity is very
steep; and it is only by hauling them up to every available
spot, that room is found for the numerous boats.</p>

<p>Here it was that Ida, the Flamebearer, is supposed to have
landed, when he achieved the conquest of Northumbria; and
here the galleys of the Sea-Kings found a precarious shelter
while the daring Northmen leapt on shore to overrun the land
in later centuries, when tradition alone preserved the remembrance
of the former invaders and their warlike deeds.</p>

<p>I was prowling hither and thither in the ravine, entertained
with the Present while imagining the Past, when the clouds,
grown every minute blacker since noon, let fall their burden
with something like tropical vehemence. For some time there
was no perceptible pause in the lightning or thunder, and
against the accompanying rain an umbrella was but as gauze.
I rushed into the arch of a neighbouring limekiln, and once in,
was kept there two hours by the roaring storm. Presently
two fishermen, speeding up from the landing, made for the
same shelter, and of course, under the circumstances, we fraternised
at once, and talked the time away.</p>

<p>Clean and well clad, they were favourable&mdash;and as I afterwards
saw&mdash;not exceptional specimens of their class. In
their opinion the Flamborough fishermen bear as good a
character as any in Yorkshire&mdash;perhaps better. About seven
years ago they all resolved to work but six days a week, and
on no account to go to sea on Sundays. They held to their
resolve, and, to the surprise of most, found themselves the
better. They earn quite as much as before, if not more, and
go to work with better spirit. During the herring season it is
a common practice with them to put into Scarborough on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Saturday evening, and journey home by rail for the Sunday,
taking advantage of the very low fares at which return tickets
are issued to fishermen. And as for diet, they take a good
store of bread and meat, pies even, in their boats, seeing no
reason why they should not live as well as their neighbours.
A glass of rum was acceptable, especially in cold and blowing
weather: but so far as they knew, there were very few
fishermen who would not &#x201c;choose hot coffee before rum any
day.&#x201d;</p>

<p>There was none of that drinking among fishermen now as
there used to be formerly. You could find some in Flamborough
&#x201c;as liked their glass,&#x201d; but none to be called drunkards.
There is a national school in the village; but not so well
attended as it might be, and perhaps would be if they had a
better schoolmaster. The people generally had pretty good
health, which is possibly the occasion why the last two doctors,
finding time hang heavy on their hands, drank themselves to
death. There is, or rather was in July, 1857, an opening for
a doctor in Flamborough.</p>

<p>The rain still fell heavily when we left our shelter, and it
kept on till past midnight. Luckily the village was not a
mile distant, and there I took a comfortable chair by the kitchen
fire of <i>The Ship</i>. The landlord corroborated all that the
fishermen had told me, with the reservation that he found it
difficult to clear his room of tipplers on Saturday night,
although none could be set down as drunkards. At times he
put on his clock ten minutes, to ensure a clearance before the
Sunday morning, resolutely refusing to refill the glasses after
twelve. The guests would go away growling out a vow never
to return to such an inhospitable house; but not one kept the
vow more than a fortnight. When, nineteen years ago, he
determined not to open his house on Sunday to any but strangers
who might chance to arrive from a distance, the village
thought itself scandalized, and the other public-houses predicted
his ruin. They were, however, mistaken. <i>The Ship</i>
still flourishes; and the host and his family &#x201c;find themselves
none the worse for going to a place of worship, and keeping
the house quiet one day in seven.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Sometimes,&#x201d; he ended, &#x201c;we don&#x2019;t think to fasten the
front door when we go to bed; but it&#x2019;s all the same; nobody
comes to disturb us.&#x201d; Which may be taken as an indication
that honesty has not yet abandoned Flamborough.</p>

to Filey.</p>

<p>A fresh, bright morning succeeded the stormy night, and it
was but a few hours old when, after a look at the old Danish
tower at the west of the village, I walked across the fields to
the lighthouse. A woman trudging in the same direction with
a hoe on her shoulder said, after I had asked her a few questions,
she wished she were a man, for then she would get nine
shillings a week and her meat, instead of one shilling a day
and feeding herself, as at present. However, &#x2019;twas better
than nothing. Presently her daughter came up, a buxom
maiden, wearing her bonnet in a way which saved her the
affliction of shrugs and the trouble of tying. It was front
behind: a fashion which leaves no part of the head exposed,
shelters the poll, and looks picturesque withal. It prevails, as
I afterwards noticed, among the rustic lasses everywhere.</p>

<p>As I passed the old stone tower near the coast-guard station,
the signal-man was busy raising and lowering his flag, for a
numerous fleet of coasting-vessels was running by to the
southward, each telling its name as it came within signal
distance. The man sends a daily list of the names to London
for publication, whereby coal-merchants and others hear of
cargoes on the way, and calculate the time of their arrival. It
is a peculiarity of Flamborough Head, an enlivening one, that
ships can keep so close in that the men on their decks are distinctly
seen, and their voices heard by one standing on the
cliff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The lighthouse, a circular white tower, eighty-two feet in
height, stands on the verge of the cliff, displaying inside and out
all that admirable order and cleanliness characteristic of
British lighthouses. There is no difficulty in obtaining admittance;
you sign your name in a book, and are forthwith
conducted up to the lantern by the chief or one of his aids.
The light is revolving, alternately white and red, and can be
seen at a distance of thirty miles. But here, elevated two
hundred and fifty feet above the sea, you feel most interested
in the prospect. No &#x201c;shadowy pomp of woods&#x201d; arrests the
eye looking landwards, but a region bleak and bare in aspect
rolling away to the distant wolds, the line of uplands which,
sweeping round, approaches the coast about Scarborough.
The village with its windmill, and the few farms that are in
sight, look naked and comfortless: not an inviting territory
for an invader given to the picturesque. But seawards, and
along the rugged front of the cliffs, grandeur and variety
exert their charm. Here the up-piled chalk flings out a bold
perpendicular buttress, solid from base to summit; there the
jutting mass is isolated by yawning cracks and chasms, and
underneath, as we shall presently see, is fretted into fantastic
shapes, pierced through and through, or worn into caverns by
the headlong billows. In places a broken slope of rocky hummocks
and patches of grass, weeds, and gravel descends, more
or less abruptly, to the beach, opening a view of the long
weed-blackened reefs that, stretching out from the Head,
afford a measure of the amazing encroachments of the sea.
Northwards, the bluff crowned by Scarborough Castle, backed
by higher elevations, closes the view; to the south you have
the low, fading coast of Holderness; and all the while brigs,
ships, and schooners are sailing past, more than a hundred in
sight, some of them so near that you fancy they will hardly
escape the lurking points of the dark reef. One small vessel,
the keeper told me, had touched the day before, and lay fast
and helpless till, the weather being calm, she floated off by the
succeeding tide. You can look down into Selwicks Bay, and
see men and boys quarrying chalk, and donkeys laden with
heavy panniers of the lumps, toiling painfully up the steep
winding road which forms the only approach. The farther
horn of the little bay is arched and tunnelled, and, taken
with the waterfall plunging down in its rear and the imposing
features of the points beyond, invites to further exploration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The residents at the lighthouse enjoy an abundant supply
of water from a spring within their enclosure: their garden
produces cabbages and potatoes; the neighbours are friendly,
and visitors numerous. Hence life is more cheerful to them
than to the amphibious hermits who dwell at the Spurn.</p>

<p>While looking for a practicable descending-place, I noticed
many tufts of thrift as thick with flowers as in an antiquated
garden where the old favourites are still cherished.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Even here hath Nature lavished hues, and scent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And melody; born handmaids of the ocean:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frowning crags, with moss and rock-flowers blent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dazzle the eyes with sunlight, while the motion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waves, the breezes fragrant from the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And cry of birds, combine one glorious symphony!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The time&mdash;dead low water&mdash;being favourable for a stroll
on the beach, I scrambled down a rough slope to the south of
the lighthouse, and across the rougher beach to the rocks
beyond the outmost point, where, turning round, I could view
the cliffs in either direction. And a striking scene it is! A
wild beach, as rugged with water-worn lumps of chalk as any
lover of chaos could desire. Here the cliff jutting proudly,
the white patches gleaming brightly where masses of chalk
have recently fallen, and the harder portions presenting a
smooth, marble-like appearance; there receding into the
shade, and terminating in darksome hollows, the mouths of
gullies and caverns; and everywhere broken up with buttresses,
piers, and columnar projections, the bases of which
are garnished with a belt of shelly incrustation, and a broad
brown fringe of weed. Above, the white surface is varied by
streaks and stains of yellow and green; and seafowl innumerable
crowd on all the ledges, or wheel and dart in restless
flight, as if proud to show their white wings to the sun.</p>

<p>The reef stretches out a quarter of a mile, as one may
guess, worn here and there with channels narrow and deep,
along which the water rolls with intermittent rush and roar,
reminding the loiterer here in the slumberous July weather
of tremendous energies lulled to repose. I walked round the
Matron&mdash;an isolated pyramid of chalk&mdash;and patted her on the
back; and strode from one little pool to another, taking an
unscientific lesson in natural history while watching the
animal and vegetable occupants, and those that seemed to be
as much one as the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>I picked up a fine specimen of the hermit crab, and proved
the strength of local attachment: it would not be coaxed from
its hermitage&mdash;the shell of a whelk. I saw a limpet give its
shell half a rotation, then grow tall for an instant, and then
shut itself snugly down upon the rock. At times, while I
stood quite still, &#x2018;ninnycocks,&#x2019; that is, young lobsters, would
venture out from their crevices, and have a frolic in their
weedy basin; but they would tolerate no intruder, and darted
into undiscoverable retreats on my slightest movement. And
the animated flowers that displayed their orange and crimson
petals at the bottom of the basin were equally mistrustful, and
shut themselves up if I did but put my hand in the water,
even after they had looked on without winking at the gambols
of the ninnycocks.</p>

<p>There are times when ignorance has a charm, and this was
one of them. How much happier to sit and watch a crowd of
weeds, a very forest in miniature, tenanted by creeping things
innumerable, and to have your faculty of wonder excited as
well as admiration while observing them in full liberty, than
to come prepared to call one an ascidian, another an entomostracan,
and so on, and to assign to each its place in the phycological
handbook, or the zoological catalogue!</p>

<p>In some of the smallest and deepest caverns which curve as
they enter the cliff, you get effects of cross lights from their
inner extremity, and see the glistening of the walls, which,
worn smooth by the water, appear to be varnished. In all the
floor rises more or less rapidly; and in one, a hundred paces
deep, the rush and roar of the surge outside comes only as a
gentle murmur, and a slow drip-drip from the crevices has an
impressive sound there in the gloom where the entrance
cannot be seen.</p>

<p>I took advantage of the opportunity, and explored most of
the openings, catching sight now and then of belemnites and
other curious fossils in the chalk, wading at times knee-deep
in weed, and scrambled round the bays on each side of the
point, and failed not to salute the venerable King and Queen.</p>

<p>Having rambled about till the rising tide began to cut off
the way round the promontories, and the crabbers came in
from their raid on the reefs, I climbed the rough slope, and
paced away for the North Landing. Beyond Selwicks Bay
the cliff is more broken and cut up into romantic coves and
bays, with confused landslips here and there, and in places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the green turf rushing half way down masks the chalk; and
everywhere are thousands of birds, with their ceaseless cry
and clang. Isolated masses are numerous; and from one
point I could count eight headlands, each pierced by an arch.
And here the water, no longer stained with clay, shows green
and bright along the base of the cliff, beautifully pellucid
where it rolls over a bottom of chalk, contrasting strangely
with darksome gulfs and broad beds of weed. And mingling
with the cry of birds, there comes from time to time to your
ear the noisy report of the guns, or the chant of the fishermen,
as rocked on the swell, they sit watching their nets.</p>

<p>The North Landing is a gap similar to the South, but
broader, and with an outlet wide enough to be described as a
bay. Here I saw some sixty or eighty boats perched from
top to bottom of the steep slope; and groups of fishermen with
their families, men, women, and children, all busy with preparations
for the herring fishery. While some sorted the nets,
others lifted in big stones for ballast, or set up the masts, and
others pushed their boats down to meet the tide, and all in
high good humour; while all about there prevailed a strong
fishy smell. And besides the fishermen, there were parties of
young men with their guns embarking for a sporting cruise;
some armed only with parasols and accompanied by ladies,
setting off for a sail round the Head; for this is the chief
port of Flamborough, and the <i>North Star</i>, a public-house at
the top of the hill, is convenient for victual.</p>

<p>The advance of the tide prevented my seeing Robin Lyth&#x2019;s
Hole, a cavern on the eastern side of the Landing; named,
as some say, after a certain smuggler who kept his unlawful
merchandise therein; or to commemorate the name of a man
who was caught in the cavern by the tide, and saved his life
by clinging to the topmost ledge till the water fell. Another
cavern is known as the Dovecote; another as Kirk Hole, and
of this the tradition runs that it extends far underground to
the village churchyard.</p>

<p>I climbed up the western side of the gap, and continued
my way along the cliffs, which maintain their elevation.
Soon I came to the northern end of the Dike, a height of
three hundred feet, and from the top beheld the whole territory
of Little Denmark, and the sea all the way round to the
lighthouse, and the southern end of the Dike. According to
Professor Phillips, this remarkable bank was probably already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
in existence when the Danes landed: &#x201c;perhaps earlier than
the Anglian invasion,&#x201d; he says; &#x201c;perhaps it is a British
work, like many other of the entrenchments on these anciently
peopled hills.&#x201d;</p>

<p>A mile farther, and the cliff rises to a height of more than
four hundred feet. In some places the bank which encloses
the fields is broad enough for a footpath; but you must beware
of the landslips. The fences, which are troublesome to
climb, project beyond the edge of the cliff to keep the cows,
as an old farmer said, &#x201c;from persevering after the grass and
tumbling over.&#x201d; Then at Speeton the chalk turns inland
away from the coast, and the cliff makes a deep hollow curve,
chiefly gravel and dark blue clay, abounding in fossils. To
avoid the curve, I zigzagged down to the beach; but was
presently stopped by a point against which the waves were
dashing breast high. I scrambled over it, and was struck by
its curious appearance. It seemed to be a high clay buttress,
which had fallen perhaps within a few weeks, and was broken
up into masses of somewhat regular form, resembling big
loaves, and the long grass that had once waved on the surface
now looked like dishevelled thatch. It was an interesting
example of the way in which the sea commences its ravages.</p>

<p>Farther on the cliffs diminish in height, and are furrowed
by numerous streamlets, and the rugged, stony beach changes
to smooth, yielding sand. Filey comes in sight, and Filey
Brig, a long black bar stretching into the sea from the extreme
point of the great bay, half concealed at times by a
quivering ridge of foam. Then we pass from the East to the
North Riding, and ere long we look up at Filey&mdash;a <i>Royal Hotel</i>,
a crescent, and rows of handsome houses, coldish of aspect, a
terrace protected by a paved slope, and gravelled paths and a
stair for easy access to the beach. The terrace commands a
view over the bay, and of the cliffs all the way to Flamborough.</p>

One Artilleryman&mdash;Scarborough Newspapers&mdash;Cloughton&mdash;The Village Inn,
and its Guests&mdash;Tudds and Pooads.</p>

<p>Here at Filey you begin to see a special characteristic of
these sea-side resorts;&mdash;the contrast between the new and
old&mdash;the nineteenth century looking proudly across a narrow
debatable ground at the sixteenth and seventeenth, putting
even still earlier periods out of countenance. Were it not
for its churches, the olden time would on occasions be made
to feel ashamed of itself.</p>

<p>A breezy commanding outlook in front; a large handsome
church, with low square tower, in the rear; a few shops
trying to reconcile themselves to the new order of things
while supplying the wants of fifteen hundred inhabitants;
more than a few true to the old order, and here and there
behind the dim panes, eggs of sea-birds, and shells, and
marine stores, in the literal sense; and two or three quiet-looking,
respectable inns, open to visitors whom the style of
the <i>Royal Hotel</i> intimidates; the new town on the south, and
a wooded ravine on the north; and such is old Filey.</p>

<p>Into this ravine I descended from the church. Heavy rain
had fallen nearly all night, and the paths were so sticky and
slippery, that I wondered so pretty a spot, so capable with
bushes and trees and a little brook of contributing to recreation,
should not be better kept. There is no lack of material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
for solid paths in the neighbourhood; but judging from appearances
the ravine gets none of it. The path follows the
course of the brook, and brings you out upon a beach where
fishing-boats, and nets, and lobster-pots, and heaps of ballast,
and a smoky fire, and fishy refuse and a smell of tar, and
sturdy men and women, make up divers pictures for the eye,
and odours for the nostrils.</p>

<p>As, on approaching Flamborough, we saw the chalk begin
to appear at the base of the cliff, so here we see a stratum of
sandstone slanting up beneath the clay, rising higher towards
the northern horn of the bay, and thence stretching out for
three furlongs into the sea, forming the remarkable reef
known as Filey Brig. Camden describes it as &#x201c;a thin slip of
land, such as the old English called File; from which the
little village Filey takes its name.&#x201d; We may suppose that
the cliff once projected as far, sheltering an indentation so
deep that Ptolemy might well call it the <i>well-havened bay</i>;
though on this particular there are different opinions among
the learned. Even now, stripped of its cap of clay, the reef
forms a natural breakwater, of which the effect is best seen
in the quiet of the small vessels at anchor behind it.</p>

<p>I was fortunate in the time, for a strong north wind was
blowing, and the great waves, checked in their career, dashed
headlong against the stony barrier, and broke into little mountains
of foam, bursting up here and there in tall white intermittent
jets as from a geyser; here one solid surge tumbling
over another, mingling with rush and roar in a wide drift of
spume; there flinging up gauzy whiffs of spray as if mermaids
in frolic were tossing their veils. So mighty were the
shocks at times as to inspire a feeling of insecurity in one
who stood watching the magnificent spectacle.</p>

<p>You can walk out to the end of the reef, and get good
views of Scarborough, about six miles distant in one direction,
and away to Flamborough on the other. The floor is
generally level, interrupted in places by great steps, channels,
and boles; and by huge blocks of many tons&#x2019; weight scattered
about, testifying mutely to the tremendous power of the
sea.</p>

<p>It is a wild scene, and wilder beyond the point, where the
whole beach is strewn with broken lumps, and ledge succeeds
to ledge, now high, now low, compelling you to many an up-and-down,
stooping under a rude cornice, or scrambling over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
a slippery ridge. In places the cliff overhangs threateningly,
or, receding, forms an alcove where you may sit and feast
your eye with the wondrous commotion, and your ear with
the thundering chorus of many waters.</p>

<p>The upper stratum of clay is worn by the twofold action
of rain and spray into singularly fantastic forms, and where
it has been deeply excavated, there, kept in by the rim of
stone, lies a salt-water pool so bright and pellucid that the
temptation to bathe therein is irresistible. I thought to get
round to Gristhorp Bay, but came presently to a recess where
the breakers rushing half way up the cliff barred all further
progress. To lean against the rocky wall and feel it throb
with the shock within the shower of spray, produced an
almost painful emotion; and it seemed to me that the more
tumultuous the sea the better did it harmonize with a promontory
so rugged and grim.</p>

<p>I retraced my steps to a stair that zigzags up the cliff on
the inner side of the point. Near this certain visitors have
cut their initials in the hard rock floor, of such dimensions
that you can only imagine a day must have been spent in the
task with mallet and chisel. Vain records! The sea will
wash them out some day. When on the summit I was struck
more than before by the contrast between the rage and uproar
on the outside of the ridge, and the comparative calm inside;
nor was it easy to leave a view to which, apart from all the
features of the shore, the restless sea added touches of the
sublime, wherein wrought fascination. And all the while
men, looking like pigmies in the distance, were groping for
crabs along each side of the far-stretching reef.</p>

<p>A little way north of the point a rustic pavilion standing
in a naked garden indicates where the visitor will find a
jutting buttress whence to contemplate the scene below.
More exposed on this side, the cliff is more cut up and broken
in outline, jutting and receding in rugged ledges, and in
every hollow rests one of those limpid pools, so calm and
clear that you can see the creeping things moving between
the patches of weed at the bottom. And the beach is thickly
strewn with boulders of a size which perhaps represents the
gravel of the &#x201c;prochronic&#x201d; era.</p>

<p>The elevation increases as we advance, and by-and-by
looking round on Filey, we see how it lies at the mouth of a
broad vale which it requires no great effort of imagination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
believe may have been an estuary at some very remote period,
near to the time</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;When the Indian Ocean did the wanton play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingling its billows with the Balticke sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whole earth was water.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And far as you can see inland the prospect is bare, even to
the distant hills and wolds which loom large and mountainous
through the hazy atmosphere.</p>

<p>Now the cliff shows bands of colour&mdash;brown, gray, and
ochre, and the lower half capped by a green slope forms a
thick projecting plinth to the perpendicular wall above.
Scarborough begins to be visible in detail, and soon we
descend into Gristhorp Bay, where rough walking awaits us.
At its northern extremity stands an insulated columnar mass,
somewhat resembling the Cheesewring, on a rude pedestal
shaped by the waves from the rocky layers. Situate about
fifty yards from the point, it marks the wear of the cliff
from which it has been detached, while the confused waste of
rocks left bare by the ebb suggests ages of destruction prior
to the appearance of the stubborn column.</p>

<p>The cliffs are of imposing height, nearly three hundred
feet: a formidable bulwark. It is heavy walking along their
base, but as compensation there are strata within reach in
which you may find exhaustless deposits of fossil plants, giant
ferns, and others. And so the beach continues round Red
Cliff into Cayton Bay, where another chaos of boulders will
try your feet and ability to pick your way. To vary the
route, I turned up at Cayton Mill, past the large reservoir
from which Scarborough is supplied with water, along the
edge of the undercliff to the high road, leaving Carnelian Bay
unvisited. At the hill-top you come suddenly upon a wide
and striking prospect&mdash;a great sweep of hilly country on one
hand, on the other the irregular margin of the cliffs all the
way to the town, and a blue promontory far beyond the castle
bluff, which marks our course for the morrow.</p>

<p>The road is good and the crops look hopeful; but the
hedgerows are scanty and stunted, and not improved by the
presence of a few miserable oaks; nor do the plantations
which shelter the farm-houses and stingy orchards appear
able to rejoice though summer be come. In some places, for
want of better, the banks are topped by a hedge of furze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
On the left of the road, long offshoots from the bleak uplands
of the interior terminate with an abrupt slope, presenting the
appearance of artificial mounds. Another rise, and there is
Scarborough in full view, crowding close to the shore of its
bay, terminated by the castle rock, the most striking feature.
Bright, showy houses scattered on the south and west indicate
the approaches to the fashionable quarter, and of those farthest
from the sea you will not fail to notice the <i>Cromwell Hotel</i>&mdash;a
new building in Swiss-like style of architecture, at the foot of
Oliver&#x2019;s Mount. The Mount&mdash;so named from a tradition that
the Protector planted his cannon there when besieging the
castle&mdash;is another of those truncated offshoots, six hundred
feet in height, and the summit, which is easily accessible and
much visited, commands an interesting prospect. You see the
tree-tops in the deep valley which divides the New Town from
the Old, and rearwards, broken ground sprinkled with wood,
imparting some touches of beauty to the western outskirts.</p>

<p>Then, turning to the right, you come upon a stately esplanade,
and not without a feeling of surprise after a few days&#x2019;
walking by yourself. For here all is life, gaiety, and fashion.
Long rows of handsome houses, of clean, light-coloured sandstone,
with glittering windows and ornamental balconies, all
looking out on the broad, heaving sea. In front, from end to
end, stretches a well-kept road, where seats, fixed at frequent
intervals, afford a pleasurable resting-place; and from this a
great slope descends to the beach, all embowered with trees
and shrubs, through which here and there you get a
glimpse of a gravelled path or the domed roof of a summer-house.
And there, two hundred feet below, is the Spa&mdash;a
castellated building protected by a sea-wall, within which a
broad road slopes gently to the sands. You see visitors
descending through the grove for their morning draught of
the mineral water, or assisting the effect by a &#x2018;constitutional&#x2019;
on the promenade beneath; while hundreds besides stroll on
the sands, where troops of children under the charge of nursemaids
dig holes with little wooden spades. And here on the
esplanade elegant pony barouches, driven by natty little
postilions, are starting every few minutes from the aristocratic
looking hotel to air gay parties of squires and dames around
the neighbourhood. And turning again to the beach, there
you see rows of bathing-machines gay with green and red
stripes, standing near the opening of the valley, and now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
then one starts at a slow pace laden with bathers to meet the
rising tide. And beyond these the piers stretch out, and the
harbour is crowded with masts, and two steamers rock at their
moorings, waiting for &#x2018;excursionists:&#x2019; the whole backed by
the houses of the Old Town rising picturesquely one above
the other, and crowning the castle heights.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour passed before I left that agreeable resting-place,
whence you get the best view of Scarborough and
its environment. Of all the strollers I saw none go beyond
what appeared to be a conventional limit; Nature without
art was perhaps too fatiguing for them. In the whole of my
walk along the coast, I met but two, and they were young
men, who had ventured a few miles from head-quarters for a
real walk on the cliffs.</p>

<p>A bridge, four hundred feet long and seventy-five high,
offers a level crossing for foot passengers from the esplanade
to the opposite side of the deep valley above mentioned, on
payment of a toll. It is at once ornamental and convenient,
saving the toil of a steep ascent and descent, and combining
the advantage of an observatory. From the centre you get a
complete view of the bay, one which the eye rests on with
pleasure, though you will hardly agree with a medical
author, that it is a &#x201c;Bay of Naples.&#x201d; In the other direction,
you look up the wooded valley, and down upon the Museum,
a Doric rotunda, built by the members of the Scarborough
Philosophical Society, for the preservation of geological
specimens. The contents are admirably classified, rocks and
fossils in their natural order; amid them rests the skeleton of
an ancient British chief; and near the entrance you may see
the clumsy oak coffin in which it was found, about twenty-five
years ago, in a barrow at Gristhorp.</p>

<p>Descend into the valley, and you will find pleasure in the
sight of the bridge, and miles of water seen through the light
and graceful arches. Then take a walk along the sands, and
look up at the leafy slope, crowned by the esplanade, and you
will commend the enterprise which converted an ugly clay
cliff into a hanging wood. And enterprise is not to stop
here: Sir Joseph Paxton, as I heard, has been consulted
about the capabilities of the cliff to the south. Some
residents, however, think that Scarborough is already overdone.</p>

<p>In a small court within the Spa you may see the health-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>giving
waters flowing from two mouths, known from their
position as North Well and South Well. The stream is
constant, and, after all the wants of the establishment are
supplied, runs across the sand to the sea. The water has a
flavour of rusty iron and salt, differing in the two wells,
although they are but a few feet apart; and the drinkers find
it beneficial in cases of chronic debility and indigestion with
their remorseless allies.</p>

<p>The contrast is more marked between New and Old than
at Filey. There is, however, a good, respectable look about
the streets of the Old Town, and signs of solid business,
notwithstanding the collections of knick-knackery and inharmonious
plate-glass. From the broad main street you
descend by a narrow crooked street&mdash;from old through oldest
to the harbour, where old anchors, old boats, old beams and
buttresses dispute possession with the builders of new boats,
who make the place noisy with their hammering. Here as
a Yorkshireman would say, were assembled all the &#x2018;ragabash&#x2019;
of Scarborough, to judge by what they said and did.
Boys and men were fishing from the pier-head under the
lighthouse, watched by grizzly old mariners, who appeared to
have nothing better to do than to sit in the sun; children
paddled in the foamy shallows of the heavy breakers; carts
rumbled slowly to and from the coal brigs, followed by stout
fellows carrying baskets of fish; a sight which might have
shamed the dissolute throng into something like industry.</p>

<p>Enclosed by the three piers which form the harbour stands
a detached pile of masonry, seemingly an ancient breakwater&mdash;all
weather-beaten, weedy, and grass-grown, with
joints widely gaping, looking as if it had stood there ever
since Leland&#x2019;s day&mdash;a remarkable object amid the stir of
trade and modern constructions, but quite in harmony with
the old pantile-roofed houses that shut in the port. Among
these you note touches of the picturesque; and your eye
singles out the gables as reminiscences of the style which,
more than any other, satisfies its desire.</p>

<p>But let us go and look down on the scene from the castle
rock. The ascent is steep, yet rich in recompense. St.
Mary&#x2019;s church, near the summit, and the fragments of old
walls standing amidst the graves, remind us of its former
dimensions, and of the demolitions it suffered during the
siege. And there rises in massive strength, to a height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
ninety feet, a remnant of the castle keep&mdash;an imposing ruin
full before us, as we cross the drawbridge, pass under the
barbican, and along the covered way, to the inner court.
But the court is a large, rough pasture, fenced on the north
and east, where the cliff is bare and perpendicular, and towards
the town shut in by a range of old wall, pierced by a
few embrasures, some low buildings, and the remains of
an ancient chapel. There is no picturesque assemblage of
ruins; but little indeed besides the shattered keep, and that
appears to best effect from without. Near the chapel, Our
Lady&#x2019;s Well, a spring famous from time immemorial, bubbles
silently up in a darksome vault.</p>

<p>Northwards the view extends along the rugged coast to the
Peak, a lofty point that looks down on Robin Hood&#x2019;s Bay,
and to hazy elevations beyond Whitby. To get a sight of
the town you must return to the barbican, where you can
step up on the wall and securely enjoy a bird&#x2019;s-eye view:
from the row of cannon which crown the precipice sheer
down to the port and away to the Spa, all lies outspread before
the curious eye.</p>

<p>A great height, as we have already proved, appears to be
favourable to musing, especially when the sun shines bright.
And here there is much to muse about. Harold Hardrada,
when on his way to defeat and death at Stamford Brig,
landed here, and climbing the &#x201c;Scarburg&#x201d; with his wild sea-rovers,
lit a huge bonfire, and tossed the blazing logs over
the cliff down upon the town beneath. The burg, or fortress,
was replaced in the reign of Stephen by a castle, which,
renewed by Henry II., became one of the most important
strongholds of the kingdom. Piers Gavestone defended it
vigorously against the Earl of Pembroke, but was starved
into a surrender, with what result we all know. The Roman
Catholics attempted it during their Pilgrimage of Grace, but
were beaten off. In 1554, however, when Queen Mary was
trying to accomplish the Pilgrims&#x2019; work, a son of Lord Stafford
and thirty confederates, all disguised as rustics, sauntered
unsuspected into the outer court, where on a sudden
they surprised the sentries, and immediately admitting a
reserve party carrying concealed arms, they made themselves
masters of the place. The success of this surprise is said to
have given rise to the adage &#x201c;Scarborough warning; a word
and a blow, and the blow first.&#x201d; But after three days the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Earl of Westmoreland regained possession, and Mr. Stafford
underwent the same sharp discipline as befel Edward the
Second&#x2019;s favourite. At length came the struggle between
Prerogative and People, and in the triumph of the right the
castle was well-nigh demolished; and since then, time and
tempest have done the rest.</p>

<p>Among the unfortunates who suffered imprisonment here,
George Fox, the aboriginal Quaker, has left us a most pathetic
account of his sufferings. Brought hither from Lancaster
Castle, he was put into a chamber which he likened to
purgatory for smoke, into which the rain beat, and after he
had &#x201c;laid out about fifty shillings&#x201d; to make it habitable,
&#x201c;they removed me,&#x201d; he writes in his <i>Journal</i>, &#x201c;into a worse
room, where I had neither chimney nor fireplace. This
being to the sea-side and lying much open, the wind drove in
the rain forcibly, so that the water came over my bed and
ran about the room, that I was fain to skim it up with a
platter. And when my clothes were wet, I had no fire to
dry them; so that my body was benumbed with cold, and my
fingers swelled, that one was grown as big as two.&#x201d; For
more than a year did the resolute Peacemaker endure pain
and privation, and vindicate his principles on this tall cliff;
and when three years later, in 1669, he again went preaching
in Yorkshire, he revisited Scarborough, and &#x201c;the governor
hearing I was come,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;sent to invite me to his
house, saying, &#x2018;surely I would not be so unkind as not to
come and see him and his wife.&#x2019; So after the meeting I
went up to visit him, and he received me very courteously
and lovingly.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Five hundred years earlier, and, as the ballad tells, the
merry outlaw, Robin Hood, who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;The Yorkshire woods frequented much,&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>being a-weary of forest glades and fallow deer, exclaimed,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;The fishermen brave more money have<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than any merchants two or three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore I will to Scarborough go,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That I a fisherman brave may be.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But though the &#x201c;widow woman&#x201d; in whose house &#x201c;he
took up his inn,&#x201d; lent him a stout boat and willing crew, he
caught no fish, and the master laughed at him for a lubber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
However, two or three days later, he espied a ship of war
sailing proudly towards them, and then it was the master&#x2019;s
turn to lament, for the French robbers spared no man. To
him then Robin:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;&#x2018;Master, tye me to the mast,&#x2019; saith he,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#x2018;That at my mark I may stand fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give me my bent bow in my hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And never a Frenchman will I spare.&#x2019;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;He drew his arrow to the very head,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And drew it with all might and maine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straightway, in the twinkling of an eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the Frenchman&#x2019;s heart the arrow&#x2019;s gane.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<hr class="hrpoem" />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Then streight they boarded the French ship<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They lyeing all dead in their sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They found within that ship of warre<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Twelve thousand pound of mony bright.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The castle is national property, and as the bluff affords a
good site for offence and defence, a magazine and barracks
for a company of men have been built. For all garrison,
at the time of my visit, there was but one invalid artilleryman,
who employs his leisure in constructing models of the
ruins for sale along with bottles of ginger beer. He will
talk to you about the nice water of Our Lady&#x2019;s Well; the
cavern in the cliff, where the officers once dined; of the
cannon balls that Cromwell sent across from Oliver&#x2019;s Mount;
about the last whale caught on the shore, and about the West
Indies, where he lost his health; but he remembers little or
nothing of Piers Gavestone or George Fox, and is not quite
sure if he ever heard that Robin Hood went a-privateering.
His duties, he told me, were not heavy; he did not even lock
the gate at night, because folk came very early in the morning
to fetch their cows from the pasture.</p>

<p>Since then, that is, in the autumn of 1857, the rains occasioned
a landslip, which nearly obliterated the cavern; a
whale thirty feet long was caught floundering in the shallows;
and on Seamer Moor, about three miles distant, ancient
gold and silver rings and ornaments, beads and broken pottery,
and implements of bronze and iron and a skeleton, were
found on excavating a chalky knoll.</p>

<p>Of course, a town of thirteen thousand inhabitants must
have its newspapers. The <i>Scarborough Gazette</i> is a curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
for its long list of visitors, filling sometimes two pages. A
cheap paper&mdash;the title of which I have lost&mdash;was a curiosity
to me in another way, for I could not have believed that
Yorkshire folk would read anything so stupid as the wordy
columns therein passed off for politics.</p>

<p>The shadows were lengthening towards the east when,
after satisfying myself with another look at the coast to the
north, I took the road for Cloughton, leaving the town by the
north esplanade, where Blenheim-terrace shows the sober
style of the first improvements. Many visitors, however,
prefer the view from those plain bay-windows to that seen
from the stately houses to the south.</p>

<p>Cloughton is a small quiet village, with a <i>Red Lion</i> to
match, where you may get good rustic fare&mdash;cakes, bacon,
and eggs&mdash;and a simple chamber. The landlord, a patriarch
of eighty-five, still hale, and active, who sat warming his
knees at the turf fire, opened his budget of reminiscences
concerning Scarborough. The change from what it was to
what it is, was wonderful. He went there at election times.
Had once been to vote at York, years ago, &#x201c;when there was
a hard fight betuxt a Milton and a Lascelles.&#x201d; Had never
been to London, but his niece went up to the Great Exhibition.
While we talked, in came a shabby-looking fellow
with a six days&#x2019; beard, for a pint of beer. He had been
trout-fishing all day on the moors&mdash;one of his means of
living. He stayed but a few minutes, and as he went out
the patriarch said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a roughish one to look at, but he
can make powetry.&#x201d; It was too late to call him back, or I
might perhaps have got a specimen.</p>

<p>Then came in the rustics in twos and threes for their
evening pint and pipe, most of them preferring hard porter to
the ale, which was really good. Not one had a complaint to
make of hard times: wages were one and sixpence a day,
and meat, and good meat, too&mdash;beef and mutton and pies&mdash;as
much as they could eat. They didn&#x2019;t want to emigrate;
Yorkshire was quite good enough for them. While talking
to them and listening to their conversation among themselves,
my old conviction strengthened that the rural folk are not
the fools they are commonly taken to be. Choose such words
as they are familiar with&mdash;such as John Bunyan uses&mdash;and
you can make them understand any ordinary subject and take
pleasure in it. And how happy they are when you can sug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>gest
an illustration from something common to their daily
life! I would have undertaken to give an hour&#x2019;s lecture on
terrestrial magnetism even, to that company; and not one
should have wished it shorter. And once having broken
through their crust of awkwardness, you find them possessed
of a good fund of common sense, quick to discern between
the plausible and what they feel to be true. Flattering
speeches made at hay-homes and harvest-homes are taken for
what they are worth; and the sunburnt throng are everywhere
ready to applaud the sentiment conveyed in a reaper&#x2019;s
reply to a complimentary toast:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Big bees fly high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little bees make the honey:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor men do the work;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich men get the money.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the party, lively enough to have lived when the
island was &#x201c;merry England,&#x201d; hearing that I intended to
walk through Bay Town on the morrow, said, laughingly,
&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find nought but <i>Tudds</i> and <i>Pooads</i> down there;&#x201d;
meaning that Todd and Poad were the prevalent names.</p>

<p>The next morning looked unpromising; the heavy rain which
began to fall the evening before had continued all night, and
when I started, trees and hedges were still dripping and the
grass drooping, overburdened with watery beads. Bye-paths
are not enticing under such circumstances: however, the
range of cliffs between Haiburn Wyke and Robin Hood&#x2019;s Bay
is so continuously grand and lofty that I made up my mind
to walk along their summit whether or not.</p>

<p>About half an hour from Cloughton brought me to a
&#x2018;crammle gate,&#x2019; as the natives call it; that is, a rustic gate
with zigzaggy rails, from which a private road curves down
through a grove to a farm-house on the right. Here, finding
no outlet, I had to inquire, and was told to cross the garden.
All praise to the good-nature which trusts a stranger to lift
the &#x201c;clinking latch&#x201d; and walk unwatched through a garden
so pretty, teeming with fruit, flowers, and vegetables; where
a path overarched by busy climbers leads you into pleasing
ins and outs, and along blooming borders to the edge of a
wooded glen, and that is Haiburn Wyke. The path, not
trimly kept as in the garden, invites you onwards beneath a
thick shade of oak, ash, and hazel; between clumps of honeysuckle
and wild roses, and broken slopes hung with ferns and
ivy, and a very forest of grasses; while, to heighten the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
charm, a little brook descends prattling confidingly to the
many stones that lie in its crooked channel. The path winds,
now steep, now gradual, and at the bends a seat offers a
resting-place if you incline to pause and meditate.</p>

<p>There was another charm: at first a fitful murmur which
swelled into a roar as I sauntered down and came nearer to the
sea. The trees grow so thickly that I could see but a few
yards around, and there seemed something almost awful in
the sound of the thundering surge, all the heavier in the damp
air, as it plunged on the rugged beach: so near, and yet
unseen. But after another bend or two it grows lighter
overhead, crags peep through the foliage on both sides, and
then emerging on a level partly filled by a summer-house, you
see the narrow cove, the jutting cliffs that shelter it, and every
minute the tumultuous sea flinging all round the stony curve
a belt of quivering foam.</p>

<p>I could not advance far, for the tide had but just begun to
fall; however, striding out as far as possible, I turned to look
at the glen. It is a charming scene: the leafy hollow, the cliffs
rounding away from the mantling green to present a bare front
to the sea, yet patched and streaked with gray and yellow and
white and brown, as if to make up for loss of verdure. There
the brook, tumbling over stony ledges, shoots into a cascade
between huge masses of rock, and hurries still with lively
noise across the beach, talking as freely to boulders of five
tons&#x2019; weight as to stones of a pound; heedless, apparently,
that its voice will soon be drowned for ever in the mighty
voice of the sea. It is a charming scene, truly, even under a
gloomy sky: you will see none fairer on all the coast. On a
sunshiny day it should attract many visitors from Scarborough,
when those able to walk might explore Cloughton Wyke&mdash;less
beautiful than this&mdash;on the way.</p>

<p>To get up the steep clay road all miry with the rain on the
northern side of the glen, was no easy task; but the great ball
of clay which clung to each of my feet was soon licked off by
the wet grass in the fields above. I took the edge of the
cliffs, and found the ascent to the Staintondale summit not
less toilsome. There was no path, and wading through the
rank grass and weeds, or through heavy wheat and drenched
barley on ground always up-hill, wetted me through up to the
hips in a few minutes, and gave me a taste of work. For
the time I did not much admire the Yorkshire thriftiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
which had ploughed and sown so close to the bank leaving no
single inch of space. However, I came at times to a bare
field or a pasture, and the freshening breeze blew me almost
dry before climbing over awkward fences for another bath of
weeds and grain. And besides, a few faint watery gleams of
sunshine began to slant down upon the sea, and the increasing
height of the cliffs opened wide views over land and water&mdash;from
misty hills looming mountainous on one side, to the
distant smoke of a coasting steamer on the other. And again
there are two or three miles of undercliff, a great slope covered
with a dense bush threaded here and there by narrow paths,
and forming in places an impenetrable tangle. To stand on
the highest point, five hundred and eighty-five feet above the
sea, and look down on the precipitous crags, the ridges and
hollows and rounded buttresses decked with the mazy bush
where birds without number haunt, is a sight that repays the
labour. At the corner of one of the fields the bushes lean
inwards so much from the wind, that the farmer has taken
advantage of the overshoot to construct a bower wherein to sit
and enjoy the prospect.</p>

<p>These tall cliffs are the sudden termination of a range of
hills stretching from the interior to the coast. Taken with
the undercliff, they present many combinations which would
delight the eye and employ the pencil of an artist. And to
the geologist they are of abounding interest, exhibiting shale,
shelly limestone, sandstones of various qualities in which
belemnites and ferns, and other animal and vegetable fossils,
are embedded in surprising quantities. You can descend here
and there by a zigzag path, and look up at the towering crags,
or search the fallen masses, or push into the thicket; that is,
in dry weather. After about two miles the bush thins off,
and gives place to gorse, and reedy ponds in the hollows, and
short turf on which cattle and sheep are grazing.</p>

<p>The range continues for perhaps five miles and ends in a
great perpendicular bluff&mdash;a resort of sea-birds. Here on
getting over the fence I noticed that the pasture had a well-kept,
finished appearance; and presently, passing the corner
of a wall, I found myself on a lawn, and in front of Raven
Hall&mdash;a squire&#x2019;s residence. An embrasured wall built to
represent bastions and turrets runs along the edge of the cliff,
and looking over, you see beneath the grand sweep of Robin
Hood&#x2019;s Bay backed by a vast hollow slope&mdash;a natural amphi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>theatre
a league in compass, containing fields and meadows,
shaly screes and patches of heath, cottages, and the Peak
alum-works. We are on the Peak, and can survey the whole
scene, away to Bay Town, a patch of red capped by pale-blue
smoke just within the northern horn of the bay.</p>

<p>A lady and gentleman were trying in defiance of the wind
to haul up a flag on the tall staff erected at the point, to whom
I apologised for my unintentional trespass. They needed no
apology, and only wondered that any one should travel along
the cliffs on such a morning. &#x201c;Did you do it for pleasure?&#x201d;
asked the lady, with a merry twinkle in her eye, as she saw
how bedraggled I looked below the knees.</p>

<p>The gentleman left the flapping banner, and showed me
from the rear of the premises the readiest way down to the
beach&mdash;a very long irregular descent, the latter portion across
the alum shale, and down the abrupt slope of Cinder Hill,
where the buildings are blackened by smoke. At first the
beach is nothing but a layer of small fragments of shale, of a
dark slate-colour, refuse from the works; and where the cliffs
reappear there you see shale in its natural condition, and feel
it beneath your feet while treading on the yielding sand.
Numerous cascades leap down from these cliffs; at the time I
passed swollen by the rain, and well set off by the dark
precipice. One of them was a remarkably good representation
of the <i>Staubbach</i> on a small scale.</p>

<p>About half way I met a gig conveying visitors to the Hall
at a walking pace, for the wheels sank deep. It was for
them that the flag was to be raised, as a signal of welcome;
and looking back I saw it flying proudly, on what, seen from
below, appeared a castle on the cliff. At this moment the
sun shone out, and lit up the Peak in all its magnificent
proportions; and the effects of my trudge through drip and
mire soon disappeared. Another mile and the rocks are
thickly strewn with periwinkles, and great plashy beds of
seaweed must be crossed, and then we see that the outermost
houses rest on a solid weather-stained wall of boulders,
through which descends a rugged incline of big stones&mdash;the
foot of the main street of Bay Town.</p>

<p>There is no lack of quarters, for within a few yards you
may count seven public-houses. It is a strange place, with
alleys which are stairs for side streets, and these leading into
queer places, back yards and pigstyes, and little gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
thriving with pot-herbs. Everything is on a slope, overtopped
by the green hill behind. Half way up the street, in
what looks like a market-place, lie a number of boats, as if
for ornament. You can hardly imagine them to have been
hauled up from the beach. Some of the shops are curiosities
in their appearance and display of wares; yet there are
traders in Bay Town who could buy up two or three of your
fashionable shopkeepers in the watering-places.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Yer master wants ye,&#x201d; said a messenger to a young
fellow who sat smoking his pipe in the <i>King&#x2019;s Head</i>, while
Martha, the hostess, fried a chop for my dinner.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Tell him I isn&#x2019;t here: I isn&#x2019;t a coomin&#x2019;,&#x201d; was the answer,
with a touch of Yorkshire, which I heard frequently
afterwards.</p>

<p>From the talk that went on I gathered that Bay Town likes
to amuse itself as well as other places. All through the past
winter a ball or dance had been held nearly every evening, in
the large rooms which, it appears, are found somewhere
belonging to the very unpretending public-houses. On the
other hand, church and chapel are well attended, and the
singing is hearty. Weddings and funerals are made the
occasion of festivals, and great is the number of guests.
Martha assured me that two hundred persons were invited
when her father was buried; and even for a child, the number
asked will be forty or fifty; and all get something to eat and
drink. It was commonly said in the neighbourhood that the
head of a Bay Town funeral procession would be at the church
before the tail had left the house. The church is on the hill-top,
nearly a mile away. A clannish feeling prevails. Any
lad or lass who should chose to wed with an outsider, would
be disgraced. Ourselves to ourselves, is the rule. On their
way home from church, the young couple are beset by invitations
to drink at door after door, as they pass, and jugs of
strong liquor are bravely drained, and all the eighteen
hundred inhabitants share in the gladness. Hence the perpetuation
of Todds and Poads. However, as regards names,
the most numerous which I saw were Granger and Bedlington,
or Bettleton, as the natives call it.</p>

<p>The trade in fish has given place to trade in coal; and Bay
Town owns about eighty coal brigs and schooners, which sail
to Edinburgh, to London, to ports in France, and one, which
belongs to a man who a few years ago was a labourer, crosses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the ocean to America. There are no such miserable paupers
as swarm in the large towns. Except the collier crews, the
folk seldom leave the parish; and their farthest travel is to
Hartlepool in the steamer which calls in the bay on her way
from Scarborough.</p>

<p>I chose to finish the walk to Whitby by the road; and in
a few minutes, so steep is the hill, was above Bay Town, and
looking on the view bounded by the massy Peak. Near
where the lane enters the high road stands the church, a
modern edifice, thickly surrounded with tombstones. Black
with gilt letters, appears to be the favourite style; and among
them are white stones, bearing outspread gilt wings and stars,
and an ornamental border. The clannish feeling loves to keep
alive the memory of the departed; and one might judge that
it has the gift of &#x201c;powetry,&#x201d; and delights in epitaphs. Let
us read a few: we shall find &#x201c;drowned at sea,&#x201d; and
&#x201c;mariner,&#x201d; a frequent word in the inscriptions:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Childhood claims a tender sentiment; and parents mourn
thus for their little ones:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One hand they gave to Jesus, one to Death,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And fled to Eden&#x2019;s ever blooming zone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The road runs along the high ground near enough to the
sea for you to hear its roar, and note the outline of the cliffs,
while inland the country rolls away hilly to the dreary region
described by old writers as &#x201c;Black-a-moor.&#x201d; Another half-hour,
and having passed through Hawsker, you see a strange-looking
building a long way off. It is the Abbey of Whitby.
And now a view opens into the Vale of Pickering; and there,
in the fields on the left, are the stones which mark where the
arrows fell, when Robin Hood and Little John, who had been
treated to a dinner at the Abbey, went up on the roof to
gratify the monks with a specimen of their skill, and proved
the goodness of their bows, and their right to rank as foremost
of English archers. As your eye measures the distance, more
than a mile, your admiration of the merry outlaws will
brighten up, unless like the incredulous antiquary, you consider
such stories as only fit to be left &#x201c;among the lyes of the
land.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Seen from the road, over the wall-top, the abbey reveals
but few of the beautiful features which charm your eye on a
nearer view. To gain admission you have to pass through an
old mansion belonging to the Cholmley family, in which, by
the way, there are rooms, and passages, and a stair, weapons,
furniture, and tapestry that remind you of the olden time;
and in the rear a delightful garden, with a prospect along the
vale of Esk. From the garden you enter a meadow, and may
wander at will about the ruin.</p>

<p>I saw it to perfection, for the sky had cleared, and the
evening sun touched the crumbling walls and massy columns
and rows of graceful arches with wondrous beauty, relieved
by the lengthening shadows. The effect of the triple rows
of windows is singularly pleasing, and there are carvings and
mouldings still remaining that will bear the closest inspection,
although it was a mason of the thirteenth century who cut
them. Three distinct styles are obvious, and you will notice
that the whitest stone, which is the oldest, is the least decayed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
An aisle still offers you the shelter of its groined roof, the
transept still shows the corbels and niches, and carved roses
that fed the eyes of Robin Hood&#x2019;s entertainers, and on the
sedilia where they sat you may now repose. Every moment
you discover some new beauty, something to increase your
admiration, and wonder that so much should be left of a
building which has not a tree to shelter it from the storms of
the sea.</p>

<p>For twelve hundred years the ground has been consecrated.
Here the blessed St. Hilda founded a monastery, and dedicated
it to St. Peter, in 658. Here it was that the famous debate
was held concerning the proper time of Easter between the
Christians who were converted by Culdee missionaries from
Ireland before St. Augustine&#x2019;s visit, and those of the later
time. It was St. John and the practice of the Eastern Church
against St. Peter and the Western; and through the eloquent
arguments of Wilfrid of Ripon, the latter prevailed.</p>

<p>Here C&oelig;dmon, one of the menial monks, was miraculously
inspired to write the poem which immortalises his name;
and here St. John of Beverley was educated. Then came the
Danish pirates under Ubba, and destroyed the monastery,
and the place lay waste till one of William the Conqueror&#x2019;s
warriors, grieved to the heart on beholding the desolation,
exchanged his coat of steel for a Benedictine&#x2019;s gown, and
rebuilt the sacred house.</p>

<p>Few who come hither will need to be reminded of that
inspiriting voyage along the coast, when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;The Abbess of St. Hilda placed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And sinking down, with flutterings faint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They do their homage to the saint.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The stately tower, the glory of the ruin, fell in 1830, at
the close of a reign, during which things good and beautiful
were unhappily but too much neglected. A rugged heap, with
lumps of stone peeping out from tufts of coarse grass, marks
the spot where the fall took place; the last, it is to be hoped,
that will be permitted in so striking a memorial of the
architecture of the past. Standing in private grounds and
surrounded by a light iron fence, it is now safe from the
intrusion of cattle and from wanton spoilers.</p>

<p>A few yards beyond the abbey, you cross St. Mary&#x2019;s churchyard
to the top of a long flight of steps, where a remarkable
scene opens suddenly beneath. Whitby, lying on each side
of the Esk, the river winding from a wooded vale, expanding
to receive the numerous vessels of the inner harbour, and
flowing away between the houses and the two piers to the sea.
The declivity is so abrupt, that the houses appear strangely
huddled together, tier above tier, in irregular masses, as if
resting one on the other, and what with the colour and variety
of forms, the shipping, the great depth of the valley, the great
bluffs with which it terminates, and line upon line of breakers
beginning to foam at two furlongs from the shore, make up a
scene surpassingly picturesque; one that you will be in no
hurry to lose sight of. If the Whitby church-goers find it
toilsome to ascend nearly two hundred steps every Sunday,
they have a goodly prospect for recompense, besides the
service.</p>

<p>One wall of the church is said to be older than any portion
of the abbey; but the edifice has undergone so many alterations,
that meritorious architecture is not now to be looked
for. A more breezy churchyard it would not be easy to find.
Opposite, on the farther cliff, is a cluster of new stone houses,
including a spacious hotel, built to attract visitors; an enterprise
promoted by King George Hudson in his palmy days.</p>

<p>I lingered, contemplating the view, till it was time to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
for an inn; I chose the <i>Talbot</i>, and had no reason to repent
my choice. On the way thither, I bought two religious
ballads at a little shop, the mistress of which told me she sold
&#x201c;hundreds of &#x2019;em,&#x201d; and that they were printed at Otley. As
specimens of a class of compositions which are relished and
sung as hymns by a numerous section of the community, they
are eminently suggestive. Do they supply a real want?
Are they harmless? Are they edifying? Can they who find
satisfaction therein be led up to something better? To close
this chapter, here follows a quotation from <i>The Railway to

<p>Though good taste and conventionality may be offended at
such hymns as these, it seems to me that if those who sing

and hearken to gladly, they would be found not unprepared
to lay hold of real truth in the end.</p>

<p>Whitby, and not Scarborough, would be my choice had I
to sojourn for a few weeks on the Yorkshire coast. What
it lacks of the style and show which characterize its aristocratic
neighbour, is more than made up by its situation on a
river and the beauty of its neighbourhood; and I regretted
not having time to stay more than one day in a place that
offers so many attractions. Woods and waterfalls beautify
and enliven the landscape; shady dells and rocky glens lie
within an easy walk, and the trip by rail to Pickering
abounds with &#x201c;contentive variety.&#x201d; And for contrast there
is always the wild Black-a-moor a few miles inland; and
beyond that again the pleasant hills and vales of Cleveland.</p>

<p>And few towns can boast so agreeable a promenade as
that from the bridge, along the spacious quay, and out to
the pier-head, a distance of nearly half a mile. Thence can
be seen all the life and movement on the river, all the picturesque
features of the heights on each side crowded with
houses, and to seaward the foaming crests of waves chasing
one another towards the land. You can see how, after
rolling and plunging on the rocky bar, they rush up the
stream with a mighty swell even to the bridge. In blowing
weather their violence is such that vessels cannot lie safely
in the lower harbour, and must shift to the upper moorings
above the bridge. On the pier-head stands a lighthouse,
built in the form of a fluted Doric column, crowned by a
gallery and lantern; and here, leaning on the encircling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
parapet, you can admire the solid masonry, or watch the
furious breakers, while inhaling the medicinal breath of the
sea. The pier on the opposite side is more exposed, serving
the purpose of a breakwater; and at times clouds of spray
leap high from its outer wall, and glisten for an instant with
rainbow hues in the sunshine.</p>

<p>It surprises a stranger on first arrival to hear what seems
to him the south bank of the river spoken of as the east bank,
and the north bank as the west; and it is only by taking into
account the trend of the coast, and the direction of the river&#x2019;s
course, that the cardinal points are discovered to be really in
their true position, and you cease to look for sunrise in the west.</p>

<p>One of the buildings at the rear of the quay contains the
Baths, and on the upper floor the Museum, and a good
Subscription Library. The Museum, which belongs to the
Literary and Philosophical Society, dates from 1823, a time
when Whitby, with the sea on one side and wild tracts of
moorlands on the other, was in a manner shut out from the
rest of the world, and compelled to rely on its own resources.
Not till 1759 was any proper road made to connect it with
neighbouring towns. Warm hospitality was thereby nourished,
and, as regards science, the result is highly meritorious. To
say nothing of the collections which represent antiquity,
ethnology, natural history, and mineralogy, the fossil specimens
are especially worth attention. Side by side with a
section of the strata of the coast from Bridlington to Redcar
is a collection of the fossils therein contained; among which
those of the immediate neighbourhood, such as may be called
Whitby fossils, occupy the chief place, all classed and labelled
in a way that shows how much may be done with small means
when the curator is in earnest. There are saurians in good
preservation, one of which was presented to the Museum for
150<i>l.</i>, by the nobleman on whose estate it was found embedded
in lias. The number of ammonites of all sizes is
surprising. These are the headless snakes of St. Hilda&#x2019;s nuns,
and the &#x201c;strange frolicks of Nature,&#x201d; of philosophers in later
days, who held that she formed them &#x201c;for diversion after a
toilsome application to serious business.&#x201d; Perhaps it is to
some superstitious notion connected with the snake-stones
that the town owes the three ammonites in its coat of arms.
In all, the fossil specimens in the Museum now amount to
nearly nine thousand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>I had the advantage of explanations from Mr. Simpson, the
curator, during my visit, and afterwards of accompanying
him and some of his friends on a walk. One of the party, a
botanist, was the first to discover the <i>Epilobium alpinum</i>
(alpine willow herb) in England, while walking one day on
the hills near Whitby. No sooner did he set eyes on it, than,
as his companions said, they thought he had taken leave of
his senses, for he leaped, shouted, danced, sang, and threw his
hat up in the air, and made other enthusiastic demonstrations
around the plant, which, up to that time, was believed not to
exist south of the Tweed. I asked him if he would have
exchanged his emotions for California.</p>

<p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he answered, &#x201c;that I wouldn&#x2019;t! At all events,
not for the first three minutes.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Besides its traffic in ship-building, alum, and stone, Whitby
has a trade in works of art which makes at least its name
known to fashionable society; and for this, as for its fossils, it
depends on the neighbouring cliffs. For many miles along
the shore, and at places inland, jet is found embedded with
other formations. Drayton makes mention of it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;The rocks by Moulgrave too, my glories forth to set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of their crany&#x2019;d cleves can give you perfect jet.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the shaping of this remarkable substance into articles
for ornament and use gives employment to five hundred men,
women, and children in Whitby. I was favoured with a
sight of Mr. Greenbury&#x2019;s manufactory, and saw the processes
from beginning to end. There is nothing mysterious about
them. The pattern of the desired object, a scroll, leaf,
flower, or whatever else, is scratched with a steel point on a
piece of jet sawn to the required dimensions; the workman
then with a knife cuts away the waste portions, brings out the
rude form, and by using various knives and chisels, according
to the delicacy of the design, he in no long time has the
article ready for the polisher. The work looks very easy, as
you watch the men cutting, apparently with less concern than
some folk bestow on the whittling of a stick, and making the
chips fly in little heaps. The nature of the jet favours
rapidity of hand. It has somewhat the appearance of compressed
pitch, and when under the knife sends off a shower of
chips and splinters as hard pitch does. Some specimens have
been found with fossils so embedded therein, as to confirm the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
opinion of those who hold jet to be a species of petroleum,
contrary to the common belief that it is wood partly converted
into coal.</p>

<p>After the knives, the grindstones come into play, to work
up and smooth all the accessible surfaces; and next swift-whirling
wheels encircled with list, which give the polish.
The deep incisions and hollows which cannot be touched by
the wheel are polished on narrow slips of list. This is the
work of boys: the slips of list are made fast by one end to
the bench, and taking hold of the other, and shifting or tightening
as the work may require, the boys rub the deep parts of
the ornaments backwards and forwards till the polish is
complete. The finishing touch, which imparts the brilliance,
is given by a sprinkling of rouge, and a light hand with the
rubber.</p>

<p>Armlets and bracelets composed of several pieces are cemented
together, forming a complete hoop, while in course
of manufacture, to ensure accuracy of workmanship, and are
separated at last for the drilling of the holes for the elastic
cord whereby they are held together in the finished state.
The drilling of these holes through each separate piece is a
nice operation, for any departure from the true line would appear
as an imperfection in the ornament.</p>

<p>What with the drilling lathes, the rapid grindstones and
polishing-wheels, and the busy artificers, from those who cut
up the jet, to the roughers-out, the carvers, the polishers in
their order, to the boys with their list rubbers, and the finishers,
the factory presented a busy scene. The boys earn from three-and-sixpence
to five shillings a week; the men from three to
four times as much. I made an inquiry as to their economical
habits, and heard in reply that the landlord of the <i>Jetmen&#x2019;s
Arms</i> could give the surest information.</p>

<p>No means have yet been discovered of working up the chips
and splinters produced in cutting the jet, so as to form solid
available blocks, as can be done with black-lead for pencils;
there is, therefore, a considerable amount of waste. The
value of jet varies with the quality; from ten to eighteen
shillings a pound. According to the report on mineral products,
by Mr. Robert Hunt, the value of the jet dug and manufactured
in England is twenty thousand pounds a year. Some of the
best shops in Whitby and Scarborough are those where jet is
sold; and not the least attractive of the displays in Regent-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>street,
is that labelled <i>Finest Whitby Jet</i>, and exhibited as
vases, chains, rings, seals, brooches, taper-stands, and obelisks.
Here in Whitby you may buy a small ammonite set in jet.</p>

<p>Jet is not a new object of luxury. It was used for ornamental
purposes by the ancient Britons, and by their conquerors,
as proved by articles found in their tombs. A trade
in jet is known to have existed in Whitby in 1598. Camden,
translating from an old <i>Treatise of Jewels</i>, has</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Jeat-stone almost a gemm, the Lybians find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fruitful Britain sends a wondrous kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#x2019;Tis black and shining, smooth, and ever light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#x2019;Twill draw up straws if rubb&#x2019;d till hot and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oyl makes it cold, but water gives it heat.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The amber mines of Prussia yield a species of jet which is
burnt as a coal.</p>

<p>Whitby presents signs of a social phenomenon which is
observable in other places: the decline of Quakerism. I was
invited to look at the Mechanics&#x2019; Institute, and found it located
in the Quakers&#x2019; Meeting House. The town was one of George
Fox&#x2019;s strongholds, and a considerable number of Quakers,
including some of the leading families, remained up to the last
generation. Death and secession have since then brought
about the result above-mentioned. Is it that Quakerism has
accomplished its work? or that it has been stifled by the
assiduous painstaking to make itself very comfortable?</p>

<p>I went up once more to the Abbey, and to enjoy the view
from the churchyard steps. The trouble of the ascent is
abundantly repaid by such a prospect: one should never tire
of it. On moonlight nights, and in a certain state of the
atmosphere, there is another attraction. It is a sight of Saint
Hilda. Incredulous as you may be, there are maidens in
Whitby who will tell you that the famous Abbess is still to
be seen hovering near the Abbey she loved so well. And when
the moon is in the right place, and a thin, pale mist floats
slowly past, then, in one of the windows, appears the image
of the saintly lady. Scott and other writers mention it; and
Professor Rymer Jones tells me that he once saw it, and with
an illusion so complete, as might easily have deceived a
superstitious beholder.</p>

<p>While looking down on the river you will hardly fail to
remember that Cook sailed from it, to begin his apprenticeship
to a seafaring life; and profiting in later years by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
early experience, he chose Whitby-built ships for his memorable
voyage of discovery. And from the Esk sailed the two
Scoresbys, father and son&mdash;two of the latest names on the list
of Yorkshire Worthies.</p>

<p>During the summer many an excursion train, or &#x2018;chape
trip,&#x2019; as the natives say, brings thousands of the hardworking
population of the West Riding, to enjoy a brief holiday by
the sea. There once arrived a party of miners two of whom
hastened down to the beach to bathe. As they undressed one
said to the other &#x201c;Hey, Sam, hoo mooky thou is!&#x201d; &#x201c;Aw
miss&#x2019;d t&#x2019; chape trip last year,&#x201d; was the laconic and significant
reply.</p>

<p>Towards evening I took a trip by railway to Grosmont (six
miles), or the Tunnel Station as it is commonly called, for a
glance at the pretty scenery of the lower part of Eskdale.
The river bordered by rocks and wooded hills enlivens the
route. From the Tunnel I walked about half a mile down
the line to a stone quarry, where a section of that remarkable
basaltic dike is exposed, which, crossing the country in a
north-westerly direction for about seventy miles, impresses the
observer with a sense of wonder at the tremendous force by
which such a mass was upheaved through the overlying
strata. Here it has the form of a great wedge, the apex
uppermost; and the sandstone, which it so rudely shouldered
aside, is scorched and partially vitrified along the line of
contact. The labourers, who break up the hard black basalt
for macadamising purposes, call it &#x2018;chaney metal.&#x2019;</p>

<p>This is a pleasant spot to loiter in; but its sylvan character
is marred by the quarrying, and by the great excavations
where busy miners dig the ironstone which abounds in the
district, after the rate, as is estimated, of twenty-two thousand
tons to the acre; no unimportant item in the exports of
Whitby, until blast furnaces shall be built to make the iron on
the spot.</p>

<p>&#x201c;The path &#x2019;ll tak&#x2019; ye up to a laan,&#x201d; said the quarryman,
with a Dutch pronunciation of lane; &#x201c;and t&#x2019; laan &#x2019;ll bring
ye doon to Egton, if ye don&#x2019;t tak&#x2019; t&#x2019; wrang turning.&#x201d; So up
through the wood I went, and came presently to the lane,
where seeing a lonely little cottage, and a woman nursing a
few flowers that grew near the door, I tarried for a short talk.
&#x2019;Twas but a poor little place, she said, and vera lonesome;
and she thought a few flowers made it look cheerful-like.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
The rent for the house and garden was but a pound a year;
but &#x2019;twas as much as she could afford, for she had had ten
children, and was thankful to say, brought &#x2019;em all up without
parish help. &#x2019;Twas hard work at times; but folk didn&#x2019;t know
what they could do till they tried. It animated me to hear
such honest words.</p>

<p>A little farther there stands a long low cottage with a
garden in front, an orchard at the side, and a row of beehives
in a corner, presenting a scene of rural abundance. I stopped
to look at the crowding flowers, and was drawn into another
talk by the mistress, who came out on seeing a stranger. I
could not help expressing my surprise at the prosperous look
of the garden, and the shabby look of the house, which
appeared the worse from a narrow ditch running along the
front. &#x201c;&#x2019;Tis a miserable house,&#x201d; she answered, &#x201c;damp and
low; but what can we do? It&#x2019;s all very well, sir, to talk
about the beautiful abbeys as they used to build in the old
days, but they didn&#x2019;t build beautiful cottages. I always think
that they built the wall till they couldn&#x2019;t reach no higher
standing on the ground, and then they put the roof on.
That&#x2019;s it, sir; anything was good enough for country-folk in
them days.&#x201d; Some modern writers contend that the abbeys
and cathedrals were but the highest expression of an architecture
beautiful and appropriate in all its degrees; but I doubt
the fact, and hold by the Yorkshirewoman&#x2019;s homely theory.</p>

<p>I suggested that the landlord might be asked to build a new
house. &#x201c;Ah, sir, you wouldn&#x2019;t say that if you knew him.
Why, he won&#x2019;t so much as give us a board to mend the door;
he&#x2019;ll only tell us where to go and buy one.&#x201d; I might have
felt surprised that any landlord should be willing to allow
English men and women to dwell in such a hovel; but she
told me his name, and then there was no room for surprise.</p>

<p>Ere long the view opens over the valley, and a charming
valley it is; hill after hill covered with wood to the summit.
Then the lane descends rapidly, and we come to the romantically
situated hamlet of Egton Bridge. This is a place
which, above all others, attracts visitors and picnic parties
from Whitby, and the <i>Oak Tree</i> is the very picture of a rustic
hostelry. Here you may fancy yourself in a deep wooded
glen; and, if limited for time, will have an embarrassing
choice of walks. Arncliffe woods offer cool green shades, and
a fine prospect from the ridge beyond, with the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to visit an ancient British village. But few can resist the
charm of the Beggar&#x2019;s Bridge, a graceful structure of a single
arch, which spans the Esk in a sequestered spot delightful to
the eye and refreshing to the ear, with the gurgling of water
and rustling of leaves. There is a legend, too, for additional
charm: how that a young dalesman, on his way to say farewell
to his betrothed, was stopped here by the stream swollen with
a sudden flood, and, spite of his efforts to cross, was forced to
retrace his steps and sail beyond the sea to seek fortune in a
distant land. He vowed, if his hopes were gratified, to build
a bridge on his return; and, to quote Mrs. George Dawson&#x2019;s
pretty version of the legend,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;The rover came back from a far distant land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he claimed of the maiden her long-promised hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he built, ere he won her, the bridge of his vow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lovers of Egton pass over it now.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A pleasant twilight walk among the trees, within hearing of
the rippling Esk, brought me back to the Tunnel in time for
the last train to Whitby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>It was yet early the next morning when I descended from
the high road to the shore at Upgang, about two miles from
Whitby. Here we approach a region of manufacturing industry.
Wagons pass laden with Mulgrave cement, with big,
white lumps of alum, with sulphate of magnesia; the kilns
are not far off, and the alum-works at Sandsend are in sight,
backed by the wooded heights of Mulgrave Park, the seat of
the Marquis of Normanby. Another half-hour, and crossing
a beck which descends from those heights, we enter Cleveland,
of which the North Riding is made to say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;&mdash;&mdash;If she were not here confined thus in me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shire even of herself might well be said to be.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hereabouts, in the olden time, stood a temple dedicated to
Thor, and the place was called Thordisa&mdash;a name for which
the present East Row is a poor exchange. The alteration, so
it is said, was made by the workmen on the commencement of
the alum manufacture in 1620. The works, now grimy with
smoke, are built between the hill-foot and the sea, a short
distance beyond the beck.</p>

<p>The story runs that the manufacture of alum was introduced
into Yorkshire early in the seventeenth century by Sir Thomas
Chaloner, who had travelled in Italy, and there seen the rock-beds
from which the Italians extracted alum. Riding one day
in the neighbourhood of Guisborough, he noticed that the
foliage of the trees resembled in colour that of the leaves in
the alum districts abroad; and afterwards he commenced an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
alum-work in the hills near that town, sanctioned by a patent
from Charles I. One account says that he smuggled over from
the Papal States, concealed in casks, workmen who were
acquainted with the manufacture, and was excommunicated
by the Pope for this daring breach of his own monopoly.
The Sandsend works were established a few years later.
Subsequently certain courtiers prevailed on the king to break
faith with Sir Thomas, and to give one-half of the patent to
a rival, which so exasperated the knight that he became a
Roundhead, and one of the most relentless foes of the king. A
great monopoly of the alum-works was attempted towards the
end of the last century by Sir George Colebroke, who, being
an East India director, got the name of Shah Allum. His
attempt failed.</p>

<p>My request for permission to view the works was freely
granted, and I here repeat my acknowledgments for the
favour. The foreman, I was told, took but little pains with
visitors who came, and said, &#x201c;Dear me! How very curious!&#x201d;
and yawned, and wanted to go away at the end of ten minutes;
but for any one in earnest to see the operations from beginning
to end, he would spare no trouble. Just the very man for me
I thought; so leaving my knapsack at the office, I followed
the boy who was sent to show me the way to the mine. Up
the hill, and across fields for about half a mile, brought us to
the edge of a huge gap, which at first sight might have been
taken for a stone quarry partially changed into the crater of a
volcano. At one side clouds of white sulphureous smoke were
rising; within lay great heaps resembling brick rubbish; and
heaps of shale, and piles of stony balls, and stacks of brushwood;
and while one set of men were busily hacking and
hewing the great inner walls, others were loading and hauling
off the tramway wagons, others pumping, or going to and fro
with wheelbarrows.</p>

<p>There was no proper descent from the side to which we
came, and to scramble down three or four great steps, each of
twenty feet, with perpendicular fronts, was not easy. However,
at last I was able to present to the foreman the scrap of
paper which I had brought from the office, and to feel sure
that such an honest countenance and bright eye as his betokened
a willing temper. Nor was I disappointed, for he at
once expressed himself ready to show and explain everything
that I might wish to see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>&#x201c;Let us begin at the beginning,&#x201d; I said; and he led me to
the cliff, where the diggers were at work. The formation
reminded me of what I had seen in the quarries at Portland:
first a layer of earth, then a hard, worthless kind of stone,
named the &#x2018;cap&#x2019; by the miners; next a deposit of marlstone
and &#x2018;doggerhead,&#x2019; making altogether a thickness of about
fifty feet; and below this comes the great bed of upper lias,
one hundred and fifty feet thick; and this lias is the alum
shale. Where freshly exposed, its appearance may be likened
to slate soaked in grease: it has a greasy or soapy feel between
the fingers, but as it oxidises rapidly on exposure to the air,
the general colour of the cliff is brown. Here the shale is
not worked below seventy-five feet; for every fathom below
that becomes more and more bituminous, and more liable to
vitrify when burnt, and will not yield alum. At some works,
however, the excavation is continued down to ninety feet.
Embedded in the shale, most abundant in the upper twenty-five
feet, the workmen find nodules of limestone, the piles of
balls I had noticed from above, about the size of a cricket-ball;
and of these the well-known Mulgrave cement is made.
The Marquis, to whom all the land hereabouts belongs, requires
that his lessees shall sell to him all the limestone nodules they
find. The supply is not small, judging from the great heap
which I saw thrown aside in readiness for carting away.
Alum shale prevails in the cliffs for twenty-seven miles along
the coast of Yorkshire, in which are found one hundred and
fifty kinds of ammonites.</p>

<p>Besides balls of limestone, the shale abounds in fossils. It
was in this&mdash;the lias&mdash;that nearly all the specimens, including
the gigantic reptiles of the ancient world which we saw in
the Museum at Whitby were found. Every stroke of the pick
brings them out; and as the shale is soft and easily worked,
they are separated without difficulty. You might collect a
cartload in half a day. For a few minutes I felt somewhat
like a schoolboy in an orchard, and filled my pockets eagerly
with the best that came in my way. But ammonites and
mussels, when turned to stone, are very heavy, and before
the day was over I had to lighten my load: some I placed
where passers-by could see them; then I gave some away at
houses by the road, till not more than six remained for a
corner of my knapsack. And these were quite enough, considering
that I had yet to walk nearly three hundred miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>After the digging comes the burning. A layer of brushwood
is made ready on the ground, and upon this the shale is
heaped to the height of forty or fifty feet until a respectable
little mountain is formed, comprising three thousand tons, or
more. The rear of the mass rests against the precipice, and
from narrow ledges and projections in this the men tilt their
barrow-loads as the elevation increases. The fire, meanwhile,
creeps about below, and soon the heap begins to smoke, sending
out white sulphureous fumes in clouds that give it the
appearance of a volcano.</p>

<p>Such a heap was smouldering and smoking at the mouth of
the great excavation, the sulphate of iron, giving off its acid
to the clay, converting it thereby into sulphate of alumina.
All round the base, and for a few feet upwards, the fire had
done its work, and the mass was cooling; but above the
creeping glow was still active. The colour is changed by the
burning from brown to light reddish yellow, with a streak of
darker red running along all the edges of the fragments; and
the progress of combustion might be noted by the differences
of colour: in some places pale; then a mottled zone, blending
upwards with the sweating patches under the smoke. Commonly
the heap burns for three months; hence a good manager
takes care so to time his fires that a supply of <i>mine</i>&mdash;as the
calcined shale is technically named&mdash;is always in readiness.
Fifty tons of this burnt shale are required to make one ton of
alum.</p>

<p>We turned to the heap which I have mentioned as resembling
a mound of brick rubbish at a distance. One-third
of it had been wheeled away to the cisterns, exposing the
interior, and I could see how the fire had touched every part,
and left its traces in the change of colour and the narrow red
border round each calcined chip. The pieces lie loosely together,
so that on digging away below, the upper part falls of
itself. The man who was filling the barrows had hacked out a
cavernous hollow; it seemed that a slip might be momentarily
expected, for the top overhung threateningly, and yet he
continued to hack and dig with apparent unconcern, and
replied to the foreman&#x2019;s caution, &#x201c;Oh! it won&#x2019;t come down
afore to-morrow. It&#x2019;ll give warning.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Now for the watery ordeal. On the sloping ground between
the cliffs and the sea, shallow pits or cisterns are sunk, nearly
fifty feet long and twenty wide, and so placed, with a bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
sloping from a depth of one foot at one end to two feet at the
other, as to communicate easily with one another by pipes and
gutters. Whether alum-works shall pay or not, is said to
depend in no small degree on the proper arrangement of the
pits. Each pit will contain forty wagon-loads of the mine.
As soon as it is full, liquor is pumped into it from a deep
cistern covered by a shed, and this at the end of three days is
drawn off by the tap at the lower end, and when drained the
pit is again pumped full and soaked for two days. Yet once
more is it pumped full, but with water&mdash;producing first,
second, and third run, and sometimes a fourth&mdash;but the last is
the weakest, and is kept to be pumped up as liquor on a fresh
pit for first run. It would be poor economy to evaporate so
weak a solution. Each pit employs five men.</p>

<p>All this is carried on in the open air, with the sea lashing
the shore but a few yards off, and all around the signs of what
to a stranger appears but a rough and ready system. And in
truth there must be something wasteful in it, for all the alum
is never abstracted. After the third or fourth washing, the
mine is shovelled from the pits and flung away on the beach,
where the sea soon levels it to a uniform slope. In one of the
so-called exhausted pits I saw many pieces touched, as it
were, by hoar frost, which was nothing but minute crystals
of alum formed on the surface, strongly acid to the taste.</p>

<p>The rest of the process was to be seen down at the works,
so thither we went; not by the way I came, for the foreman,
scrambling up the side of the gap, conducted me along the
ledge at the top of the burning heap. He walked through the
stifling fumes without annoyance, while on me they produced
a painful sense of choking, with an impulse to run. Before
we had passed, however, he pushed aside a few of the upper
pieces, and showed me the dull glow of the fire beneath.
Then we had more ledges along the face of the cliff, and now
and then to creep and jump; and we crossed an old digging,
which looked ugly with its heaps of waste and half-starved
patches of grass. All the way extends a course of long
wooden gutters, in which the first-run liquor was flowing in
a continuous stream to undergo its final treatment&mdash;another
trial by fire.</p>

<p>Then into a low, darksome shed, where from one end to
the other you see nothing but leaden evaporating pans and
cisterns, some steaming, and all containing liquor in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
states of preparation. That from which the most water has
been evaporated&mdash;the concentrated solution&mdash;has a large
cistern to itself, where its tendency to crystallize is assisted by
an admixture of liquor containing ammonia in solution, and
immediately the alum falls to the bottom in countless crystals.
The liquor above them, now become &#x2018;mother liquor,&#x2019; or more
familiarly &#x2018;mothers,&#x2019; is drawn off, the crystals are washed
clean in water, are again dissolved, and once more boiled,
mixed with gallons of mothers remaining from former boilings.
When of the required density, the liquor is run off from the
pan to the &#x2018;roching casks&#x2019;&mdash;great butts rather, big as a
sugar hogshead, and taller; and in these is left to cool and
crystallize after its manner, from eight to ten days, according
to the season. The butts are constructed so as to take to
pieces easily, and at the right time the hoops are knocked off,
the staves removed, and there on the floor stands a great white
cask of alum, solid all over, top, bottom, and sides, except in its
centre a quantity of liquor which has not crystallized. This
having been drawn off by a hole driven through, the mass is
then broken to pieces, and is fit for the market; and for the
use of dyers, leather-dressers, druggists, tallow-chandlers; for
bakers even, and other crafty traders.</p>

<p>Looked at from the outside, there is no beauty in the cask
of alum; but as soon as the interior is exposed, then the
numberless crystals shooting from every part, glisten again as
the light streams in upon them; and you acknowledge that
the cunning by which they have been produced from the dull
slaty shale is a happy triumph of chemical art&mdash;one that will
stand a comparison with a recent triumph, the extraction of
brilliantly white candles from the great brown peat-bogs of
Ireland, or from Rangoon tar. Perhaps some readers will
remember the beautiful specimen of alum crystals&mdash;an entire
half-tun that stood in the nave of the Great Exhibition.</p>

<p>Alum is made near Glasgow from the shale of abandoned
coal mines, soaked in water without burning. After the
works had been carried on for some years, and the heap of
refuse had spread over the neighbourhood to an inconvenient
extent, it was found that on burning this waste shale, it would
yield a second profitable supply of alum. Moreover, artificial
alum is manufactured in considerable quantities from a mixture
of clay and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>In going about the works it was impossible not to be struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
by the contrast between the sooty aspect of the roofs, beams,
and gangways, and the whiteness of the crystal fringes in the
pans, and the snowy patches here and there where the vapour
had condensed. And in an outhouse wagon-loads of &#x2018;rough
Epsoms&#x2019; lay in a great white heap on the black floor. This
rough Epsoms, or sulphate of magnesia, is the crystals thrown
down by the mother-liquor after a second boiling.</p>

<p>In our goings to and fro, we talked of other things as well
as alum; of that other mineral wealth, the ironstone, to which
Cleveland owes so important a development of industry
within the past fifteen years. The existence of ironstone in
the district had long been known; but not till the foreman&mdash;jointly
with his father&mdash;discovered a deposit near Skinningrave,
and drew attention to it, was any attempt made to
work it. Geologically the deposit is known as clayband ironstone;
hence clay will still make known the fame of this
corner of Yorkshire, as when the old couplet was current&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Carry in two shoon, bring one away.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If I liked the foreman at first sight, much more did I like
him upon acquaintance. He won my esteem as much by his
frank and manly bearing, as by his patient attentions and
intelligent explanations; and I shook his hand at parting with
a sincere hope of having another talk with him some day.</p>

<p>I shouldered my knapsack, and paced once more up the hill:
a long and toilsome hill it is; but you can beguile the way
nevertheless. Behind the hedge on the left stretches Mulgrave
Park, hill and dale, and running brooks, and woods wherein
the walks and drives extend for twenty miles. I had procured
a ticket of admission at Whitby; but having spent so much
time over the alum, had none to spare for the park, with its
Gothic mansion, groves and gardens, and fragment of an old
castle on an eminence surrounded by woods; and the Hermitage,
the favourite resort of picnic parties. According to hoary
legend, the original founder of the castle was giant Wade, or
Wada, a personage still talked of by the country-folk, who
give his name to the Roman Causeway which runs from
Dunsley to Malton, and point out certain large stones at two
villages a few miles apart as Wade&#x2019;s Graves. It was in
Dunsley Bay, down there on the right, that Ubba landed with
his sea-rovers in 867, and the hill on which he planted his
standard is still called Ravenhill.</p>

<p>And here were the haunts of the boggle-boggarts&mdash;a
Yorkshire fairy tribe. At Kettleness, whither we shall
come by and by, they used to wash their linen in a certain
spring, named Claymore Well, and the noise of their
&#x2018;bittle&#x2019; was heard more than two miles off. Jeanie, one of
these fairies, made her abode in the Mulgrave woods, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
one day a young farmer, curious to see a bogle, mounted his
horse, rode up to her bower, and called her by name. She
obeyed the call, but in a towering rage at the intrusion, and
the adventurer, in terror, turned and fled, with the nimble
sprite close at his heels. At length, just as he was leaping
a brook, she aimed a stroke with her wand and cut his horse
in two; but the fugitive kept his seat, and fell with the
foremost half on the farther bank, and the weird creature,
stopped by the running water, witnessed his escape with an
evil eye.</p>

<p>We may remember, too, that Cleveland, remote from great
thoroughfares, was a nursery of superstitions long after the
owlish notions died out from other places. Had your grandmother
been born here she would have been able to tell you
that to wear a ring cut from old, long-buried coffin-lead,
would cure the cramp; that the water from the leaden roof of
a church, sprinkled on the skin, was a specific for sundry
diseases&mdash;most efficacious if taken from over the chancel.
Biscuits baked on Good Friday would keep good all the
year, and a person ill with flux had only to swallow one
grated in milk, or brandy-and-water, and recovery was certain.
Clothes hung out to dry on Good Friday would,
when taken down, be found spotted with blood. To fling
the shirt or shift of a sick person into a spring, was a sure
way to foreknow the issue of the malady: if it floated&mdash;life;
if it sank&mdash;death. And when the patient was convalescent,
a small piece was torn from the garment and hung on the
bushes near the spring; and springs thus venerated were
called Rag-wells.</p>

<p>The lands of Mulgrave were given by King John to Peter
de Malolacu as a reward for crime&mdash;helping in the cruel
murder of Prince Arthur. By this Knight of the Evil-lake&mdash;evil
heart, rather&mdash;the castle was rebuilt; and, pleased
with the beauty of the sight, he named it Moult Grace; but
because that he was hard-hearted and an oppressor, the
people changed the <i>c</i> into <i>v</i>; whence, says tradition, the
origin of the present name.</p>

<p>On the crown of the hill we come to Lythe, which&mdash;to
borrow a term from Lord Carlisle&mdash;is a &#x201c;well-conditioned&#x201d;
village, adorned with honeysuckle and little flower-gardens.
The elevation, five hundred feet, affords an agreeable view
of Whitby Abbey, and part of the intervening coast and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
country. The church is dedicated to St. Oswald, the royal
Northumbrian martyr; and inside you may see a monument
to Constantine John, Baron Mulgrave, who as Captain
Phipps sailed to Spitzbergen in 1773, on one of those arctic
explorations to which, from first to last, England owes no
small share of her naval renown.</p>

<p>Here I struck into a lane for Goldsborough, the village
which claims one of Wade&#x2019;s graves; and along byeways
down to the shore at Kettleness&mdash;a grand cliff nearly four
hundred feet high, so named from hollows or &#x2018;kettles&#x2019; in
the ground near it.</p>

<p>Here, descending the steep road to the beach, you pass
more alum-works, backed by the precipitous crags. Everywhere
you see signs of fallen rocks and landslips. In a slip
which happened in 1830, the labourers&#x2019; cottages were carried
down and buried; but with sufficient warning to enable the
inmates to escape. Once the cliff took fire and burned for
two years. From this point the way along the shore is
wilder and rougher&mdash;more bestrewn with slabs and boulders
than any we have yet seen. Up and down, in and out;
now close under the cliff; now taking to the weedy rocks
to avoid an overhanging mass that seems about to fall.
Here and there jet-diggers and quarrymen are busy high
above your head, and make the passage more difficult by
their heaps of rubbish. Among the boulders you will
notice some perfectly globular in form, as if finished in a
lathe. One that I stooped to examine was a singular specimen
of Nature&#x2019;s handiwork. It proved to be a hemisphere
only, smooth and highly polished, so exact a round on one
side, so true a flat on the other, that no artificer could have
produced better. In appearance it resembled quartz. I
longed to bring it away; but it was about the bigness of half
an ordinary Dutch cheese, and weighed some five or six
pounds. All I could do was to leave it in a safe spot for
some after-coming geologist.</p>

<p>Having passed the bluff, we see to the bottom of Runswick
Bay, and the village of Runswick clustered on the
farther heights. A harbour of refuge is much wanted on
this shelterless coast, and some engineers show this to be
the best place for it; others contend for Redcar, at the
mouth of the Tees. Here, again, the cliff diminishes in elevation,
and the ground slopes upwards to higher land in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
rear. About the middle of the bay is Hob-Hole, a well-known
cave, once more than a hundred feet deep, but now
shortened by two-thirds, and in imminent danger of complete
destruction by jet-diggers. Cattle used to come down
from the pastures and betake themselves to its cool recesses
in hot summer days, and if caught by the tide instinctively
sought the inner end, which, as the floor rose by a gentle
acclivity, was above the reach of the water. I could scarcely
help fancying that the half-dozen cows standing up to their
knees in a salt-water pool were ruminating sadly over their
lost resort.</p>

<p>What would the grandmothers say if they could return
and see the spoiling of Hob&#x2019;s dwelling-place: Hob, whose
aid they used to invoke for the cure of whooping-cough?
Standing at the entrance of the cave with the sick child in
their arms, they addressed him thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&#x201c;Hob-hole Hob!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bairn&#x2019;s gotten t&#x2019;kin cough:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Tak &#x2019;t off&mdash;tak &#x2019;t off!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If Hob refused to be propitiated, they tried another way,
and catching a live hairy worm, hung it in a bag from
the child&#x2019;s neck, and as the worm died and wasted away so
did the cough. If this failed, a roasted mouse, or a piece of
bread-and-butter administered by the hands of a virgin, was
infallible; and if the cough remained still obstinate, the
child, as a last resort, was passed nine times under the belly
of a donkey. To avoid risk of exposure, it was customary to
lead the animal to the front of the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>I found a party of jet-diggers at work in the low cliff
near the cave, and stayed to watch their proceedings.
Eleven weeks had they been labouring, and found nothing.
It was astonishing to see what prodigious gaps they had
made in that time, and the heap of refuse, which appeared
twice as big as all the gaps put together. I thought the
barrow-man gave himself too little trouble to wheel the
waste out of the way; but he, who knew best, answered,
&#x201c;Bowkers! why should I sweat for nothin&#x2019;? The sea&#x2019;ll tak &#x2019;t
all away the fust gale.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Judging from what they told me, jet-digging is little,
if any, less precarious than gold-digging. Their actual
experience was not uncommon; and at other times they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
would get as much jet in a week as paid them for six
months&#x2019; labour. Then, again, after removing tons of superincumbent
rock, the bed of jet would be of the hard stony-kind,
worth not more than half-a-crown a pound; or a party
would toil fruitlessly for weeks, losing heart and hope, and
find themselves outwitted at last by another crafty digger,
who, scanning the cliff a few yards off with a keen eye,
would discover signs, and setting to work, lay bare a stratum
of jet in a few days. The best kind is thoroughly bitumenized,
of a perfect uniform black, and resembles nothing
so much as a tree stem flattened by intense pressure, while
subjected to great heat without charring.</p>

<p>If Bay Town be remarkable, much more so is Runswick,
for the houses may be said to hang on the abrupt hill-side,
as martens&#x2019; nests on a wall, among patches of ragwort,
brambles, gorse, elders, and bits of brown rock, overtopped
by the summit of the cliff. Boats are hauled up on the grass,
near the rivulet that frolics down the steep; balks of pine
and ends of old ship timbers lie about; clothes hung out to
dry flutter in the breeze; and the little whitewashed gables,
crowned by thatch or red tiles, gleam in the sunshine. There
is no street, nothing but footpaths, and you continually find
yourself in one of the little gardens, or at the door of a
cottage, while seeking the way through to the heights above.
Two public-houses offer very modest entertainment, and <i>The
Ship</i> better beer than that at Kilnsea. About the end of the
seventeenth century the alum shale, on which the village is
built, made a sudden slip, and with it all the houses but one.
Since then it has remained stationary; but with a rock so liable
to decomposition as alum shale, a site that shall never be
moved cannot be hoped for.</p>

<p>The view from the brow in the reverse direction, after you
have climbed the rough slope of thorns and brambles above
the village, is striking. Kettleness rears its head proudly over
the waters; and looking inland from one swelling eminence
to another, till stopped by a long bare hill, which in outline
resembles the Hog&#x2019;s-back, your eye completes the circle and
rests at last on the picturesque features of the bay beneath.
There is no finer cliff scenery on the Yorkshire coast than
from Kettleness to Huntcliff Nab.</p>

<p>Then turning my face northwards, I explored the shortest
way to Staithes, now on the edge of the cliff, now cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
across the fields, and leaving on the left the village of Hinderwell&mdash;once,
as is said, St. Hilda&#x2019;s well, from a spring in
the churchyard which bore the pious lady&#x2019;s name. About
four miles of rough walking brought me to a bend in the road
above a deep ravine, which, patched or fringed with wood towards
its upper end, submits its steep flanks to cultivation on
approaching the sea. Garden plots, fenced and hedged, there
chequer the ground; and even from the hither side you can
see how well kept they are, and how productive. Facing the
south, and sheltered from the bitter north-easters, they yield
crops of fruit and vegetables that would excite admiration
anywhere, and win praise for their cultivators. In some of
the plots you see men at work with upturned shirt-sleeves,
and you can fancy they do their work lovingly in the golden
evening light. The ravine makes sharp curves, each wider
than the last, and the brook spreads out, with a few feet of
level margin in places at which boats are made fast, and you
wonder how they got there. Then the slope, with its gardens,
elders, and flowers, merges into a craggy cliff, near which an
old limekiln comes in with remarkably picturesque effect.</p>

<p>A few yards farther and the road, descending rapidly, brings
you in sight of the sea, seemingly shut in between two high
bluffs, and at your feet, unseen till close upon it, lies the little
fishing-town of Staithes. And a strange town it is! The
main street, narrow and painfully ill-paved, bending down to
the shore of a small bay; houses showing their backs to the
water on one side, on the other hanging thickly on a declivity
so steep that many of the roofs touch the ground in the rear:
frowsy old houses for the most part, with pantile roofs, or
mouldy thatch, from which here and there peep queer little
windows. Some of the thatched houses appear as if sunk
into the ground, so low are they, and squalid withal. Contrasted
with these, the few modern houses appear better than
they are; and the draper, with his showy shop, exhibits a
model which others, whose gables are beginning to stand at
ease, perhaps will be ambitious to follow. Men wearing thick
blue Guernsey frocks and sou&#x2019;-westers come slouching along,
burdened with nets or lobster-pots, or other fishing gear;
women and girls, short-skirted and some barefooted, go to and
from the beck with &#x2018;skeels&#x2019; of water on their head, one or
two carrying a large washing-tub full, yet talking as they go
as if the weight were nothing; and now and then a few sturdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
fellows stride past, yellow from head to foot with a thick
ochre-like dust. They come from the ironstone diggings
beyond Penny Nab&mdash;the southern bluff. Imagine, besides,
that the whole place smells of fish, and you will have a first
impression of Staithes.</p>

<p>The inns, I thought, looked unpromising; but the <i>Royal
George</i> is better than it looks, and if guests are not comfortable
the blame can hardly lie with Mrs. Walton, the
hostess&mdash;a portly, good-humoured dame, who has seen the
world, that is, as far as London, and laughs in a way that
compels all within hearing to laugh for company. Though
the tap-room and parlour be sunk some three feet below the
roadway, making you notice, whether or not, the stout ankles
of the water-bearers, you will find it very possible to take
your ease in your inn.</p>

<p>I was just sauntering out after tea when a couple of negro
minstrels, with banjo and tambourine, came down the street,
and struck up one of their liveliest songs. Instantly, and as
if by magic, the narrow thoroughfare was thronged by a
screeching swarm of children, who came running down all
the steep alleys, and from nooks and doorways in the queerest
places, followed by their fathers and mothers. I stepped up
the slope and took a survey of the crowd as they stood
grinning with delight at the black melodists. Good-looking
faces are rare among the women; but their stature is
remarkably erect&mdash;the effect probably of carrying burdens
on the head. How they chattered!</p>

<p>&#x201c;Eh! that caps me!&#x201d; cried one.</p>

<p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s brave music!&#x201d; said another.</p>

<p>And a third, when Tambourine began his contortions,
shrieked, &#x201c;Eh! looky! looky! he&#x2019;s nobbut a porriwiggle;&#x201d;
which translated out of Yorkshire into English, means,
&#x201c;nought but a tadpole.&#x201d; And to see how the weather-beaten
old fishermen chuckled and roared with laughter,
showing such big white teeth all the while, was not the least
amusing part of the exhibition. Such lusty enjoyment I
thought betokened an open hand; but when the hat went
round the greater number proved themselves as &#x2018;close-neaved,&#x2019;
to use one of their own words, as misers.</p>

<p>Near the end of the street, and under the shadow of Penny
Nab, there is an opening whence you may survey the little
bay, or rather cove, which forms the port of Staithes, well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
protected by the bluff above-named, and Colburn Nab on the
north. Here the <i>Cod and Lobster</i> public-house, with a small
quay in front, faces the sea, as if indifferent to consequences,
notwithstanding that the inmates are compelled from time to
time to decamp suddenly from threatened drowning. Even
as I stood there I was fain to button my overcoat against the
spray which swept across and sprinkled the windows, for there
was a heavy &#x2018;lipper&#x2019; on, and huge breakers came tumbling
in with thunderous roar. You see piles driven here and there,
and heaps of big stones laid for protection; and not without
need, you will think, while looking at the backs of the houses
huddling close around the margin of the tide. In the month
of February, twenty-seven years ago, thirteen houses were
swept away at once, and among them the one in which Cook
was first apprenticed. Judging from what Staithes is now, it
must have been a remarkably primitive and hard-featured
place in his day.</p>

<p>Then, crossing over, I threaded the narrow alleys and paths
to look at the backs of the houses from the hill-side. You
never saw such queer ins and outs, and holes and corners as
there are here. Pigstyes, little back yards, sheds, here and
there patches of the hill rough with coarse grass and weeds,
and everywhere boat-hooks and oars leaning against the walls,
and heaps of floats, tarred bladders, lobster-pots and baskets,
and nets stretched to dry on the open ground above. If you
wished to get from one alley to another without descending
the hill, it would not be difficult to take a short cut across the
pantiles. Indeed, that seems in some places the only way to
extrication from the labyrinth.</p>

<p>I was on my way to look at the cove from the side of
Colburn Nab, when a woman, rushing from a house, renewed
a screeching quarrel with her opposite neighbour, which had
been interrupted by the negro interlude. The other rushed
out to meet her, and there followed a clamour of tongues
such as I never before heard&mdash;each termagant resolute to
outscold the other. They stamped, shook their fists and
beat the air furiously, made mouths at one another, yelled
bitter taunts, and at last came to blows. The struggle was
but short, and then the weaker, not having been able to
conquer by strength of arm, screamed hoarsely, &#x201c;Never
mind, Bet&mdash;never mind, you faggot! I can show a cleaner
shimmy than you can.&#x201d; And, turning up her skirt, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
showed half a yard of linen, the cleanness of which ought to
have made her ashamed of her tongue. A loud laugh followed
this sally, and the men, having maintained their
principle that &#x201c;it&#x2019;s always best to let t&#x2019; women foight it
out,&#x201d; straggled away to their lounging-places.</p>

<p>The beck falls from the ravine into the cove at the foot
of the Nab, having a level wedge of land between it and the
cliff. This was more than half covered by fishing-boats and
the carts of dealers, who buy the fish here and sell it in the
interior, or convey it to the Tunnel Station for despatch by
railway. Two smoke houses for the drying of herrings are
built against the cliff, and in one of these a man was preparing
for the annual task, and shovelling his coarse-grained
salt into tubs. &#x201c;The coarser the better,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;because
it keeps the fish from layin&#x2019; too close together.&#x201d; A fisherman,
who seemed well pleased to have some one to talk to,
assured me that I was a month too soon: the middle of
August was the time to see the place as busy as sand-martens.
And with an overpowering smell of fish, he might have
added. Six score boats of one kind or another sailed from
the cove, and they took a good few of fish. Some boats
could carry twenty last, and at times a last of herrings would
fetch ten or eleven pounds. In October, &#x2019;56, the boats were
running down to Scarbro&#x2019;, when they came all at once into
a shoal, and was seven hours a sailin&#x2019; through &#x2019;em. One
boat got twelve lasts in no time, came in on Sunday, cleared
&#x2019;em out, sailed again, and got back with twelve more lasts on
Wednesday. That was good addlings (<i>i. e.</i> earnings). He
knowed the crew of one boat who got sixty pound a man
that season.</p>

<p>Some liked cobles, and some liked yawls. A coble wanted
six men and two boys to work her: a yawl would carry
fifty tons, and some were always out a fishin&#x2019;. Now and
then they went out to the Silver Pit, an oyster-bed about
twenty-five miles from the coast. He thought the French
and Dutch were poachers in the herring season, especially
the French. They&#x2019;d run their nets right across the English
nets, and pretend they didn&#x2019;t know or didn&#x2019;t understand; and
though the screw steamer from Dunkirk kept cruising about
to warn &#x2019;em not to come over the line, the English fishermen
thought &#x2019;twas only to spy out where the most fish was, and
then let the foreign boats know by signal. Yorkshire can&#x2019;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
a-bear such botherments, and retaliates between whiles by
sinking the buoy barrels.</p>

<p>This is an old grievance. In former times, no Dutchmen
were permitted to fish without a license from Scarborough
Castle, yet they evaded the regulation continually; &#x201c;for,&#x201d;
to quote the old chronicler, &#x201c;the English always granted
leave for fishing, reserving the honour to themselves, but out
of a lazy temper resigning the gain to others.&#x201d;</p>

<p>He remembered the gale that swallowed the thirteen
houses. &#x2019;Twas a northerly gale, and that was the only
quarter that Staithes had to trouble about. Whenever the
wind blew hard from the north, the <i>Cod and Lobster</i> had to
get ready to run. But the easterly gales, which made everything
outside run for shelter, never touched the place, and
you might row round the port in a skiff when collier ships
were carrying away their topmasts in the offing, or drifting
helplessly ashore. He saw the thirteen houses washed away,
and at the same time a coble carried right over the bridge and
left high and dry on the other side.</p>

<p>The mouth of the beck would make a good harbour for
cobles were it not for the bar, a great heap of gravel &#x2018;fore-anenst&#x2019;
us, which, by the combined action of the stream and
tide, was kept circling from side to side, and stopping the
entrance. It would be all right if somebody would build a
jetty.</p>

<p>Of the two hundred and fifty species of fish known to
inhabit the rivers and shores of Britain, one hundred and
forty have been found in and around Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Returned to my quarters, I preferred a seat in the tap-room
to the solitude of the parlour. The hour to &#x201c;steck
up&#x201d; shops had struck, and a few of the &#x201c;bettermy&#x201d; traders
had come in for their evening pipe and glass of ale. The
landlord, who is a jet-digger, confirmed all that the three
men had told me at Runswick: jet-digging was quite a lottery,
and not unattended with danger. In some instances
a man would let himself half way down the cliff by a rope
to begin his work. And the doctor&mdash;a talkative gentleman&mdash;corroborated
the old fisherman&#x2019;s statements. In an
easterly gale the little port was &#x201c;as smooth as grease,&#x201d; and,
if it were only larger, would be the best harbour on the
eastern coast. He, too, remembered the washing away of
the thirteen houses, and the consternation thereby created.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Would the sea be satisfied with that one mouthful? was a
terrible question in the minds of all.</p>

<p>I had heard that among the few things saved from the
house in which Cook was apprenticed, was the till from
which he stole the shilling; but although I met with persons
who thought the relic was still preserved somewhere in
the town, not one could say that he had ever seen it. As
regards the story of the theft, the popular version is that
Cook, after taking the coin, ran away from Staithes. But,
according to another version, there was no stealing in the
case. Tempted by the sight of a bright new South-Sea
Company&#x2019;s shilling in the till, he took it out, and substituted
for it one from his own pocket; and his master, who combined
the trades of haberdasher and grocer, was satisfied with
the boy&#x2019;s explanation when the piece was missed. Cook,
however, fascinated by the sight of the sea and of ships,
took a dislike to the counter, and, before he was fourteen,
obtained his discharge, and was learning the rudiments of
navigation on board the <i>Freelove</i>, a collier ship, owned by two
worthy Quakers of Whitby.</p>

to the Sea.</p>

<p>It is the morning of our last day by the sea; and a glorious
morning it is, with a bright sun, a blue sky, and a cool, brisk
breeze, that freshens still as the hours glide on to noon. It is
one of those days when merely to breathe, to feel that you are
alive, is enjoyment enough; when movement and change of
scene exert a charm that grows into exhilaration, and weariness,
the envious thief, lags behind, and tries in vain to overtake
the willing foot and cheerful heart. In such circumstances it
seems to me that from all around the horizon the glowing
sunlight streams into one&#x2019;s very being laden with the delight-fullest
influences of all the landscapes.</p>

<p>Though the hill be steep and high by which we leave
Staithes, there are gaily painted boats lying on the grass at
the top. You might almost believe them to be placed there as
indications that the town, now hidden from sight, really exists
below. Northwards, the cliffs have a promising look, for they
rise to a higher elevation (six hundred and sixty feet) than
any we have yet trodden on this side of Flamborough. Again
we pass wagon-loads of alum and sulphate, and come to the
Boulby alum-works, beyond which a wild heathery tract
stretches sharply upwards from the edge of the cliff, and shuts
out the inland prospect. Up here the breeze is half a gale,
and the sea view is magnificent. More than a hundred vessels
of different sizes are in sight, the greater number bowling
along to the southward, with every stitch of canvas spread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and so near the shore that you can see plainly the man at the
wheel, and the movements of the crew on deck.</p>

<p>By the roadside runs a stream of alum liquor along the
wooden trough, and on rounding the bluff, we discover more
alum-works on a broad undercliff, with troughs, diggings, and
refuse heaps, extending farther than you can see. You may
continue along the broken ground below, or mount to the
summit by a rude stair chopped in the face of the cliff. The
higher the better, I thought, and scrambled up. It is a strange
scene that you look down upon: a few lonely cottages, patches
of garden, and a chaos of heaps, some grass-grown, with
numerous paths winding among them. And now the view
opens towards the west, great slopes of fields heaving up as
waves one beyond the other, till they blend with the pale blue
hill-range in the distance; and glimpses of Hartlepool and
Tynemouth can be seen in the north.</p>

<p>The Earl of Zetland is the great proprietor hereabouts: the
alum-works are his, and to him belongs the estate at Lofthouse&mdash;a
village about two miles inland&mdash;once owned by the famous
Zachary Moore, whose lavish hospitality, and eminent qualities
of mind and heart, made him the theme for tongue and pen
when Pitt was minister:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;What sober heads hast thou made ache!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How many hast thou kept from nodding!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many wise ones for thy sake<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have flown to thee and left off plodding!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and who, having spent a great fortune, discovered the reverse
side of his friends&#x2019; characters, accepted an ensign&#x2019;s commission,
and died at Gibraltar in the prime of his manhood.</p>

<p>And it was near Lofthouse that Sir John Conyers won his
name of Snake-killer. A sword and coffin, dug up on the site
of an old Benedictine priory, were supposed to have once belonged
to the brave knight who &#x201c;slew that monstrous and poysonous
vermine or wyverne, an aske or werme which overthrew
and devoured many people in fight; for that the scent of that
poison was so strong that no person might abyde it.&#x201d; A gray
stone, standing in a field, still marks the haunt of the worm
and place of battle.</p>

<p>Tradition tells, moreover, of a valiant youth, who killed a
serpent and rescued an earl&#x2019;s daughter from the reptile&#x2019;s cave,
and married her; in token whereof Scaw Wood still bears his
name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>As I went on, past Street Houses, diverging hither and
thither, a woman cried, from a small farm-house, &#x201c;Eh! packman,
d&#x2019;ye carry beuks?&#x201d; She wanted a new spelder-beuk<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
for one of her children. We had a brief talk together. She
had never been out of Yorkshire, except once across the Tees
to Stockton, twenty-two miles distant. That was her longest
journey, and the largest town she had ever seen. &#x2019;Twas a gay
sight; but she thought the ladies in the streets wore too many
danglements. She couldn&#x2019;t a-bear such things as them, for
she was one of the audfarrand<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> sort, and liked lasty<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> clothes.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Spelling Book.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Old-fashioned.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> Lasting.</p></div>

<p>While talking, she continued her preparations for dinner,
and set one of her children to polish the &#x201c;reckon-crooks.&#x201d;
The &#x201c;reckon&#x201d; is the crane in the kitchen fireplace, to which
pots and kettles are suspended by the &#x201c;crooks.&#x201d; In old times,
when a pot was lifted off, the maid was careful to stop the
swinging of the crook, because, whenever the reckon-crooks
swung the blessed Virgin used to weep.</p>

<p>Skinningrave&mdash;a few houses at the mouth of a narrow
valley, a brook running briskly to the sea, a coast-guard
station on the green shoulder of the southern cliff&mdash;makes up
a pleasing scene as you descend to the beach. The village
gossips can still talk on occasion about the golden age of
smugglers, and a certain parish-clerk of the neighbourhood,
who used to make the church steeple a hiding-place for his
contraband goods. Smuggling hardly pays now on this coast.
They can repeat, too, what they heard in their childhood concerning
Paul Jones; how that, as at Whitby, the folk kept
their money and valuables packed up, ready to start for the
interior, watching day and night in great alarm, until at length
the privateers did land, and fell to plundering from house to
house. But when the fugitives returned they found nothing
disturbed except the pantries and larders.</p>

<p>This was one of the places where the Bruce, proudest of
the lords of Cleveland, had &#x201c;free fisheries, plantage, floatage,
lagan, jetsom, derelict, and other maritime franchises.&#x201d; And
an industrious explorer, who drew up a report on the district
for Sir Thomas Chaloner, in that quaint old style which smacks
of true British liberty, gives us a glimpse of Skinningrave
morals in his day. The people, he says, with all their fish,
were not rich; &#x201c;for the moste parte, what they have they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
drinke; and howsoever they reckon with God, yt is a familiar
maner to them to make even with the worlde at night, that
pennilesse and carelesse they maye go lightly to their labour
on the morrow morninge.&#x201d; And, relating a strange story, he
tells us that about the year 1535, certain fishers of the place
captured a sea-man, and kept him &#x201c;many weekes in an olde
house, giving him rawe fish to eate, for all other fare he
refused. Instead of voyce he skreaked, and showed himself
courteous to such as flocked farre and neare to visit him; faire
maydes were wellcomest guests to his harbour, whome he
woulde beholde with a very earnest countenaynce, as if his
phlegmaticke breaste had been touched with a sparke of love.
One day when the good demeanour of this newe gueste had
made his hosts secure of his abode with them, he privily stole
out of doores, and ere he could be overtaken recovered the sea,
whereinto he plunged himself; yet as one that woulde not
unmannerly depart without taking of his leave, from the
mydle upwardes he raysed his shoulders often above the waves,
and makinge signes of acknowledgeing his good entertainment
to such as beheld him on the shore, as they interpreted yt.
After a pretty while he dived downe, and appeared no more.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Give me leave, reader, to quote one more passage, in
which our narrator notices the phenomenon now known as
the calling of the sea. &#x201c;The little stream here,&#x201d; he says,
&#x201c;serveth as a trunke or conduite to convey the rumor of
the sea into the neighbouring fieldes; for when all wyndes
are whiste, and the sea restes unmoved as a standing poole,
sometimes there is such a horrible groaninge heard from
that creake at the least six myles in the mayne lande, that
the fishermen dare not put forth, thoughe thyrste of gaine
drive them on, houlding an opinion that the sea, as a greedy
beaste raginge for hunger, desyers to be satisfyed with men&#x2019;s
carcases.&#x201d;</p>

<p>I crossed the beach where noisy rustics were loading carts
from the thick beds of tangle, to the opposite cliff, and
found a path to the top in a romantic hollow behind the
point. Again the height increases, and presently you get
a peep at Handale, traceable by its woods; and Freeburgh
Hill, which was long taken for a tumulus, appears beyond.
After much learned assertion in favour of its artificial formation,
the question was settled by opening a sandstone
quarry on its side. Still higher, and we are on Huntcliff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Nab, a precipice of three hundred and sixty feet, backed by
broad fields and pastures. Farther, we come to broken
ground, and then to a sudden descent by a zigzag path at the
Saltburn coast-guard station; and here the noble range of
cliffs sinks down to one of the pleasantest valleys of Cleveland&mdash;an
outlet for little rivers. Pausing here on the brow
we see the end of our coast travel, Redcar, and the mouth
of the Tees five miles distant, and all between the finest
sandy beach washed by the North Sea: level and smooth as
a floor. The cliff behind is a mere bank, as along the shore
of Holderness, and there is a greater breadth of plain country
under our eye than we have seen for some days past.</p>

<p>Among the hills, picturesquely upheaved in the rear of
the plain, I recognized the pointed summit of Rosebury
Topping; and with almost as much pleasure as if it had
been the face of a friend, so many recollections did the sight
of the cone awaken of youthful days, and of circumstances
that seemed to have left no impression. And therewith came
back for a while the gladsome bounding emotions that consort
with youth&#x2019;s inexperience.</p>

<p>Some time elapsed before I could make up my mind to
quit the turfy seat on the edge of the cliff, and betake myself
to the nether ground. The path zigzags steeply, and
would be dangerous in places were it not protected by a
handrope and posts. At the public-house below the requisites
of a simple dinner can be had, and excellent beer.
While I ate, two men were busy casting bullets, and turning
them out to cool in the middle of the floor. They were
going to shoot cormorants along Huntcliff Nab, where the
birds lodge in the clefts and afford good practice for a rifle.</p>

<p>Concerning the Nab, our ancient friend describes it as
&#x201c;full of craggs and steepe rocks, wherein meawes, pidgeons,
and sea-fowle breade plentifully; and here the sea castinge
up peble-stones maketh the coaste troublesome to passe.&#x201d;
And seals resorted to the rocks about its base, cunning animals,
which set a sentry to watch for the approach of men,
and dived immediately that the alarm was given. But
&#x201c;the poore women that gather cockles and mussels on the
sandes, by often use are in better credyte with them. Therefore,
whosoe intends to kill any of them must craftely put
on the habyte of a woman, to gayne grounde within the
reache of his peece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>&#x201d;</p>

<p>The sands at the mouth of the valley are furrowed and
channeled by the streams that here find their outlet; and
you will get many a splash in striding across. The view of
the valley backed by hills and woods is a temptation, for
yonder lie fair prospects, and the obscure ruins of Kilton
Castle; but the sea is on the other side, and the sands stretch
away invitingly before us. Their breadth, seen near low
water, as when I saw them, may be guessed at more than
half a mile, and from Saltburn to Redcar, and for four or five
miles up the estuary of the Tees they continue, a gentle
slope dry and firm, noisy to a horse&#x2019;s foot, yet something
elastic under the tread of a pedestrian. At one time the
Redcar races were always held on the broad sands, and
every day the visitors to the little town resort to the smooth
expanse for their exercise, whether on foot or on wheels.
For my part, I ceased to regret leaving the crest of the cliffs,
and found a novel sense of enjoyment in walking along the
wide-spread shore, where the surface is smooth and unbroken
except here and there a solitary pebble, or a shallow pool, or
a patch left rough by the ripples. And all the while a thin
film, paler than the rest, as if the surface were in motion, is
drifting rapidly with the wind, and producing before your eyes,
on the margin of the low cliff, some of the phenomena of
blown sands.</p>

<p>Smugglers liked this bit of the coast, because of the easy
access to the interior; and many a hard fight has here been
had between them and the officers of the law in former times,
and not without loss of life. The lowlands, too, were liable
to inundation. Marske, of which the church has been our
landmark nearly all the way from Saltburn, was once a marsh.
If we mount the bank here we shall see the marine hotel, and
the village, and the mansion of Mr. Pease, who is the railway
king of these parts. And there is Marske Hall, dating from
the time of Charles the First, which, associated with the names
of Fauconberg and Dundas, has become historical. In the
churchyard you may see the graves of shipwrecked seamen,
and others indicated by a series of family names that will
detain you awhile. Here in April, 1779&mdash;that fatal year&mdash;was
buried James Cook, the day-labourer, and father of the
illustrious navigator. And truly there seems something
appropriate in laying him to rest within hearing of that
element on which his son achieved lasting renown for himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and his country. Providence was kind to the old man, and
took him away six weeks after that terrible massacre at
Owhyhee, thereby saving his last days from hopeless sorrow.</p>

<p>Numerous are the parties walking, riding, and driving on the
sands within a mile of Redcar; but so far as a wayfarer may
judge, liveliness is not one of their characteristics. Now, the
confused line of houses resolves itself into definite form; and,
turning the point, you find the inner margin of the sand loose
and heavy, a short stair to facilitate access to the terrace
above, all wearing a rough makeshift appearance: the effect,
probably, of the drift. There is no harbour; the boats lie far
off in the shallow water, where embarkation is by no means
convenient. Once arrived at the place, it appeared to me
singularly unattractive.</p>

<p>Wide as the estuary looks, its entrance is narrowed by a
tongue of sand, Seaton-Snook, similar to the Spurn, but seven
miles long, and under water, which stretches out from the
Durham side; and on the hither side, off the point where we
are standing, you can see the long ridges of lias which are
there thrust out, as if to suggest the use that might be made
of them. Twenty years ago Mr. Richmond drew up a report
on what he names an &#x201c;Asylum Harbour&#x201d; at Redcar, showing
that at that time forty thousand vessels passed in a year, and
that of the wrecks, from 1821 to 1833, four hundred and
sixty-two would not have happened had the harbour then
existed. &#x201c;To examine and trace,&#x201d; he remarks, &#x201c;during a
low spring-ebb, the massive foundations, which seem laid by
the cunning hand of Nature to invite that of man to finish
what has been so excellently begun, is a most interesting
labour. In their present position they form the basis on which
it is projected to raise those mounds of stone by whose means,
as breakwaters, a safe and extensive harbour will be created,
with sufficient space and depth of water for a fleet of line-of-battle
ships to be moored with perfect security within their
limits, and still leave ample room for merchant vessels.&#x201d;
There is no lack of stone in the neighbourhood; and seeing
what has been accomplished at Portland and Holyhead, there
should be no lack of money for such a purpose.</p>

<p>Cockles and shrimps abound along the shore: hence visitors
may find a little gentle excitement in watching the capture
of these multitudinous creatures, or grow enthusiastic over the
return of the salmon-fishers with their glistening prey. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
in fine weather there are frequent opportunities for steam-boat
trips along the coast. But the charm of the place consists in
the broad, flat shore, and, looking back along the way you
came, you will find an apt expression in the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Next fishy Redcar view Marske&#x2019;s sunny lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sands, beyond Pactolus&#x2019; golden sands;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>William Hutton, at the age of eighty-five, journeyed
hither for a summer holiday, and wrote a narrative of his
adventures, from which we may get an idea of the place as
he saw it. &#x201c;The two streets of Coatham and Redcar,&#x201d; he
says, &#x201c;are covered with mountains of drift sand, blown by
the north-west winds from the shore, which almost forbid the
foot; no carriage above a wheelbarrow ought to venture. It
is a labour to walk. If a man wants a perspiring dose, he
may procure one by travelling through these two streets,
and save his half-crown from the doctor. He may sport
white stockings every day in the year, for they are without
dirt; nor will the pavement offend his corns. The sand-beds
are in some places as high as the eaves of the houses. Some
of the inhabitants are obliged every morning to clear their
doorway, which becomes a pit, unpleasant to the housekeeper
and dangerous to the traveller.&#x201d;</p>

<p>I saw no sand-beds up to the eaves, but there were indications
enough that the sand-drift must be a great annoyance.
The town is comprised chiefly in one long, wide street, which
looks raw and bleak, even in the summer. There are a few
good shops at the end farthest from the sea; and if you ask
the bookseller to show you the weekly list of visitors, it will
perhaps surprise you to see the number so great. The church
was built in 1829; before that date church-goers had to walk
three miles to Marske.</p>

<p>And now my travel from Humber to Tees is accomplished,
and I must say farewell to the wide rolling main with its
infinite horizon&mdash;to the ships coming up from the unseen
distance, and sailing away to the unseen beyond&mdash;to the great
headlands, haunted by swift-winged birds, which, when winds
are still, behold a double firmament, stars overhead and stars
beneath; and so, not without reluctance, I turn my back on
what the rare old Greek calls</p>

<p>However, we will be of good cheer, for Nature forsakes
not the trustful heart. Hill and dale, breezy moorland,
craggy mountains, and lovely valleys stretch away before us
well-nigh to the western tides; and there we shall find
perennial woods, where rustling leaves, and rushing waterfalls
will compensate us for the loss of the voice of the sea.</p>

<p>I started for Guisborough, taking a short cut across the
fields to Kirkleatham. In the first field, on the edge of the
town, I saw what accounted to me for the lifelessness of
Redcar&mdash;a cricket-match. As well might one hope to be
merry at a funeral as at a game of cricket, improved into its
present condition; when the ball is no longer bowled, but
pelted, and the pelter&#x2019;s movements resemble those of a jack-pudding;
when gauntlets must be worn on the hands and
greaves on the shins; and other inventions are brought into use
to deprive pastime of anything like enjoyment. That twenty-two
men should ever consent to come together for such a
mockery of pleasure, is to me a mystery. Wouldn&#x2019;t Dr.
Livingstone&#x2019;s Makalolo laugh at them! The only saving
point attending it is, that it involves some amount of exercise in
the open air. No wonder that the French duchess, who was
invited to see a game, sent one of her suite, after sitting two
hours, to enquire, &#x201c;vhen the creekay vas going to begin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>&#x201d;
The Guisborough band was doing its best to enliven the field;
but I saw no exhilaration. Read Miss Mitford&#x2019;s description
of a cricket-match on the village green; watch a schoolboys&#x2019;
game, consider the mirth and merriment that they get out of
it, and sympathise with modern cricket if you can.</p>

<p>The fields are pleasant and rural; haymakers are at work;
we cross a tramway, one of those laid to facilitate the transport
of Cleveland ironstone; we get glimpses of Coatham,
and come nearer to the woods, and at length emerge into the
road at Kirkleatham. Here let us turn aside to look at the
curious old hospital, built in 1676 by Sir William Turner,
citizen and woollen-draper of London, and lord mayor, moreover,
three years after the Great Fire. There it stands, a
centre and two wings, including a chapel, a library and
museum, and a comfortable lodging for ten old men, as many
old women, and the same number of boys and girls. The
endowment provides for a good education for the children, and
a benefaction on their apprenticeship; and the services of a
chaplain. Among the curiosities shown to visitors are a
waxen effigy of Sir William, wearing the wig and band that
he himself once wore; the likeness of his son and heir in the
stained glass of one of the windows; St. George and the
Dragon, singularly well cut out of one piece of boxwood;
the fragment of the tree from Newby Park, presented by Lord
Falconberg, on which appears, carved:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">This Tre long time witnese beare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of toww lovrs that did walk heare.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was no random hand that selected the library; some of
the books are rare. One who loves old authors, will scan the
shelves with pleasure. &#x201c;I could easily have forgotten my
dinner in this enchanting room,&#x201d; says William Hutton. Interesting
in another way is the ledger of the worthy citizen
and woollen-draper here preserved: it shows how well he
kept his accounts, and that he was not vain-glorious. On one
of the pages, where the sum of his wealth appears as 50,000<i>l.</i>,
he has written, &#x201c;Blessed be the Almighty God, who has blest
me with this estate.&#x201d;</p>

<p>The church, not far from the hospital, is worth a visit.
Conspicuous in the chancel are the monuments of the Turners,
adorned with sculptures and long inscriptions. Of Sir
William, we read that he lies buried &#x201c;amongst the poor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
his hospital&mdash;the witnesses of his piety, liberality, and humility.&#x201d;
There is the mausoleum erected by Cholmley Turner,
in 1740, to the memory of his son, who died at Lyon, of
which Schumacher was the sculptor, and near it the tomb
of Sir Charles Turner, the last of the family. Cook, accompanied
by Omai and Sir Joseph Banks, paid him a visit in
1775. Some of the church plate was presented by Sir
William; but that used for the communion was thrown up by
the sea about a century ago, within the privilege of the lord
of the manor.</p>

<p>This quiet little village of Kirkleatham was the birthplace
of Tom Browne the famous dragoon, who at the battle of
Dettingen cut his way single-handed into the enemy&#x2019;s line,
recovered the standard of the troop to which he belonged, and
fought his way back in triumph; by which exploit he made
his name ring from one end of England to the other, and won
a place for his likeness on many a sign-board. You may see
his portrait here if you will, and his straight basket-hilted
sword.</p>

<p>After a glance at the hall, a handsome building, we return
to the road, and ascend Yearby bank&mdash;a bank which out of
Yorkshire would be called a hill. Look back when near the
top, and you will have a pleasing prospect: Kirkleatham nestled
among the trees, the green fields refreshing to the eye; Eston
Nab and the brown estuary beyond. Here we are on the
verge of the Earl of Zetland&#x2019;s richly wooded estate&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Behold Upleatham, slop&#x2019;d with graceful ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hanging enraptur&#x2019;d o&#x2019;er the winding Tees&#x201d;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the breeze makes merry among the branches that overhang
us on both sides till a grand fragment of a ruin appears
in sight&mdash;the tall east window of a once magnificent Priory&mdash;rising
stately in decay from amidst the verdure of a fertile
valley, and we enter the small market-town of Guisborough.</p>

<p>Having refreshed myself at <i>The Buck</i>, I took an evening
stroll, not a little surprised at the changes which the place
had undergone since I once saw it. Then it had the homely
aspect of a village, and scarce a sound would you hear after
nine at night in its long wide street: now at both ends new
houses intrude on the fields and hedgerows, the side lanes have
grown into streets lit by gas and watched by policemen.
Tippling iron-diggers disturb the night with noisy shouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
when sober folk are a-bed, and the old honest look has
disappeared for ever. In the olden time it was said, &#x201c;The
inhabitants of this place are observed by travellers to be very
civil and well bred, cleanly in dressing their diet, and very
decent in their houses.&#x201d; The old hall is gone, but the gardens
remain: you see the ample walnut-trees and the primeval
yew behind the wall on your way to the churchyard. Seven
centuries have rolled away since that Norman gateway was
built, and it looks strong enough to stand another seven.
Under the shadow of those trees was a burial-place of the
monks: now the shadow falls on mutilated statues and other
sculptured relics, and on the tomb of Robert Brus, one of the
claimants of the Scottish throne and founder of the abbey,
who was buried here in 1294. Even in decay it is an
admirable specimen of ancient art.</p>

<p>From the meadow adjoining the churchyard you get a
good view of the great east window, or rather of the empty
arch which the window once filled; and looking at its noble
dimensions, supported by buttresses, flanked by the windows
of the aisles, and still adorned with crumbling finials, you will
easily believe what is recorded of Guisborough Priory&mdash;that
it was the richest in Yorkshire. It was dedicated to St.
Augustine, and when the sacred edifice stood erect in beauty,
the tall spire pointing far upwards, seen miles around, many a
weary pilgrim must have invoked a blessing on its munificent
founder&mdash;a Bruce of whom the Church might well be proud.</p>

<p>Hemingford, whose chronicle of events during the reigns of
the first three Edwards contains many curious matters of
ecclesiastical history, was a canon of Guisborough; and among
the priors we find Bishop Pursglove, him of whom our ancient
gossip Izaak makes loving mention. Another name associated
with the place is Sir Thomas Chaloner, eminent alike in exercises
of the sword, and pen, and statesmanship. It was here
in the neighbourhood that he discovered alum, as already
mentioned, led thereto by observing that the leaves of the
trees about the village were not so dark a green as elsewhere,
while the whitish clay soil never froze, and &#x201c;in a pretty clear
night shined and sparkled like glass upon the road-side.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Skeletons and stone coffins have been dug up from time to
time, and reburied in the churchyard. On one occasion the
diggers came upon a deposit of silver plate; and from these
and other signs the presence of a numerous population on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
spot in former days has been inferred. Our quaint friend,
who has been more than once quoted, says: &#x201c;Cleveland hath
been wonderfully inhabited more than yt is nowe ... nowe all
their lodgings are gone; and the country, as a widow, remayneth
mournful.&#x201d; And among the local traditions, there
is the not uncommon one, which hints obscurely at a subterranean
passage, leading from the Priory to some place adjacent,
within which lay a chest of gold guarded by a raven.</p>

<p>Situate near the foot of a finely-wooded range of hills,
the ruin shows effectively with the green heights for a background.
More delightful than now must the prospect have
been in the early days, and even within the present century,
when no great excavations of ironstone left yellow blots in
the masses of foliage.</p>

<p>The sun went down while I sauntered about, and when
I took my last look at the great east window the ruddy
blaze streamed through its lofty space, and as each side
grew dark with creeping glooms, filled it with quivering
beams whereunto all the glory of glass would be but a
mockery.</p>

<p>Guisborough may claim to rank among watering-places, for
it has a spa, with appliances for drinking and bathing, down
in a romantic nook of Spa Wood, watered by Alumwork
beck. The walk thither, and onwards through Waterfall
wood to Skelton, is one of the prettiest in the neighbourhood.
And on the hill-slopes, Bellman bank&mdash;formerly Bellemonde&mdash;still
claims notice for pleasing scenery. The medicinal
properties of the spring were discovered in 1822. The water,
which is clear and sparkling, tastes and smells slightly of
sulphur and weak alkaline constituents, and is considered
beneficial in diseases of the skin and indigestion. And in
common with other small towns in Yorkshire, Guisborough
has a free grammar-school, which, at least, keeps alive the
memory of its founder.</p>

<p>Mine host of <i>The Buck</i> said, as we talked together later
in the evening about the changes that had taken place, that
although more money came into the town than in years gone
by, he did not think that better habits or better morals came
in along with it. A similar remark would be made wherever
numbers of rude labourers earn high wages. Even in the
good old times there was something to complain of. George
Fox tells us, concerning his proselytes in Cleveland, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
fell away from their first principles and took to ranting; and
at the time of his later visits &#x201c;they smoked tobacco and drank
ale in their meetings, and were grown light and loose.&#x201d;
And John Wesley, on his first visit to Guisborough, in 1761,
found what was little better than practical heathenism. He
preached from a table standing in the market-place, where
&#x201c;there was,&#x201d; as he writes, &#x201c;so vehement a stench of stinking
fish as was ready to suffocate me.&#x201d; The people &#x201c;roared;&#x201d;
but as the zealous apostle of Methodism went on in his sermon
they gradually became overawed, and listened in silence.
Did their forefathers ever roar when Paulinus preached to
them from a mossy rock, or under the shadow of a spreading
oak? Wesley, however, made an impression, and followed it
up by visits in four subsequent years.</p>

<p>At any rate, there was no noise to disturb the Sunday quiet
when I went forth on the morrow. While passing along the
street I noticed many cottagers reading at their doors, and
exposing a pair of clean white shirt-sleeves to the morning
sun. Turning presently into a road on the left, which rises
gently, you get an embowered view of the town, terminated
by the soaring arch. Then we come to Hutton Lowcross, a
pleasant hamlet, which suggests a thought of the days of old,
for it once had an hospital and a Cistercian nunnery. Hutton
joined to the name of a village is a characteristic of Cleveland.
In one instance&mdash;a few miles from this&mdash;it helps out
an unflattering couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Hutton Rudby, Entrepen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far more rogues than honest men.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We cross the railway near a station, which, as a cottager
told me is &#x201c;Mr. Pease&#x2019;s station; built for hisself, and not for
everybody;&#x201d; and take a bridle road leading to the hill. I
fell in with a couple of rustics, who were able to enjoy the
scenery amid which they had lived for years. They lay
under a tree, at a spot open to the prospect down the valley;
and as I commended their choice, one replied &#x201c;I do like to
come and set here of a Sunday better than anything else.
&#x2019;Tis so nice to hear the leaves a-rustlin&#x2019; like they do now.&#x201d;
But the view there was nothing to what I should see from the
hill-top: there couldn&#x2019;t be a prettier sight in England than
that.</p>

<p>I felt willing to believe them; and a few minutes later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
strode from the steep, narrow lane, where ferns, foxgloves,
wild roses, and elders overhang the way, to the open expanse
of Guisborough moors. Here a track runs along the undulating
slope to the foot of the hills, which roll away on the
left to the wild region of Black-a-moor, with many a pleasant
vale and secluded village between, while on the right spreads
the cultivated plain, of which, ere long, we shall get a wider
view; for now Rosebury Topping comes clear in sight, from
gorse-patched base to rocky apex, and your eye begins to select
a place for ascent. It is approachable on all sides; no swamp
betrays the foot, but the steepness in some places compels you
to use hands as well as feet. The morning was already hot,
and I was fain to sit down in the belt of bracken above the
gorse and breathe awhile, glad to have climbed beyond reach
of the flies. From the fern you mount across clean, soft
turf to the bare wall of rock which encircles the northern
half of the summit, where the breeze of the plain is a brisk
wind, cooling and invigorating as it sweeps across. I threw
off my knapsack, and choosing a good resting-place, lay down
in idle enjoyment of being able to see far enough.</p>

<p>Who that has travelled knows not what an enjoyment it is
to recline at length on a hill-top, the head reposing on a
cushion of moss, and to have nothing to do but let the eye
rove at will over the wide-spread landscape below? Sheltered
by the rock, you breathe the coolness of upper air without
its rapid chill, and indulge for a while in lazy contemplation.
It is the very luxury of out-door existence. Perhaps you are
somewhat overcome by the labour of the ascent, and unconsciousness
steals gently on you; and a snatch of slumber in
such a spot, while the winds whisper of gladness in your ear,
and a faint hush floats to and fro among the blades of grass,
is a pleasure which can be imagined only by one who beholds
at his awaking the blue sky and the broad earth of the great
Giver.</p>

<p>At length curiosity prevails. Here we are a thousand and
twenty-two feet above the sea&mdash;an elevation that sounds small
after Switzerland and Tyrol; but a very little experience of
travelling convinces one that the highest hills are not those
which always command the most pleasing views. Standing
on the top of the crag you may scan the whole ring of the
horizon, from the sea on the east to the high summits of the
west; from the bleak ridges of Black-a-moor to the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>lands
of Northumberland, seen dimly through the smoky
atmosphere of the Durham coal-fields.</p>

<p>Considering, reader, that I may please myself at times, as
well as you, I borrow again from our honest friend, whose
admiration of the picturesque appears to have equalled his
ability to note the useful. &#x201c;There is,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;a most
goodly prospecte from the toppe of thys hyll, though paynefully
gayned by reason of the steepnesse of yt.... There you
may see a vewe the like whereof I never saw, or thinke that
any traveller hath seen any comparable unto yt, albeit I have
shewed yt to divers that have paste through a greate part of
the worlde, both by sea and land. The vales, rivers, great
and small, swelinge hylls and mountaynes, pastures, meadows,
woodes, cornefields, parte of the Bishopricke of Durham, with
the newe porte of Tease lately found to be safe, and the sea
replenyshed with shippes, and a most pleasant flatt coaste
subjecte to noe inundation or hazarde make that countrye happy
if the people had the grace to make use of theire owne
happinesse, which may be amended if it please God to send
them trafique and good example of thrifte.&#x201d; All this is still
true; but Tees has now other ports, and Middlesborough,
which has grown rapidly as an American town, and the iron
furnaces, spread a smoky veil here and there across the landscape,
which, when our narrator looked down upon it, lay
everywhere clear and bright in the sunshine.</p>

<p>The name of the hill is said to be derived from <i>Ross</i>, a heath
or moor; <i>Burg</i>, a fortress; and <i>Toppen</i>, Danish for apex.
If you incline to go back to very early days&mdash;as the Germans
do&mdash;try to repeople the rows of basin-like pits which, traceable
around the slope of the hill, are, so the students of
antiquity tell us, the remains of ancient British dwellings.
Were they inhabited when the Brigantes first mustered to
repel the Romans? Rebuild the hermitage which, constructed
once by a solitary here in the rock, was afterwards known
as the smith&#x2019;s forge or cobbler&#x2019;s shop; and restore the crevice
which, far-famed as Wilfrid&#x2019;s needle, tempted many a pilgrim
to the expiatory task of creeping through the needle&#x2019;s eye.
No traces of them are now left, for the remains which Time
respected were destroyed some years ago by quarrymen, and
with them the perfect point of the cone.</p>

<p>Rosebury Topping was once talked of as the best site for a
monument to the memory of Cook, where it would be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
from his birthplace and for miles around. But another spot
was chosen, and looking to the south-east you see the tall,
plain column on Easby heights, about three miles distant. It
was erected in 1827, at the cost of Mr. Robert Campion, of
Whitby. At the foot of the hill, in the same direction, partly
concealed by trees, and watered by the river Leven, lies the
village of Great Ayton&mdash;canny Yatton&mdash;where Cook went to
school after finishing his course of Mary Walker&#x2019;s lessons. In
the churchyard is a stone, which records the death of Cook&#x2019;s
mother, and of some of his brothers and sisters, supposed to
have been wrought by his father, who was a working mason.
It is said, however, that the old man was unable to read until
the age of seventy-five, when he learned in order that he
might have the pleasure of reading the narrative of his son&#x2019;s
voyages of discovery. Of other noteworthy objects in the
village are a monument to Commodore Wilson in the church;
a Chapel-well of the olden time; and an agricultural school,
with seventy-five acres of good land attached, belonging
to the Quakers. Farming work and in-doors work are
there taught to boys and girls in a thoroughly practical way,
carrying out the intentions of the chief promoter, who gave
the land and 5000<i>l.</i> to establish the institution.</p>

<p>A few yards below the rocks a spring trickles slowly into a
hollow under a stone, but the quantity of water is too small to
keep itself free from the weeds and scum which render it
unfit for drinking. It can hardly be the fatal spring of the
tradition, wherein is preserved the memory of a Northumbrian
queen and Prince Oswy, her son. Soothsayers had foretold
the boy&#x2019;s death by drowning on a certain day: the mother, to
keep him from harm, brought him to this lofty hill-side early
on the threatened day, where, at all events, he would be in
no danger from water. Fondly she talked with him for a
while and watched his play: but drowsiness stole over her and
she fell asleep. By-and-by she woke, and looked hastily
round for her darling. He was nowhere to be seen. She flew
hither and thither, searching wildly, and at last found him
lying dead, with his face in the spring.</p>

<p>Looking to the north-east we see Skelton, backed by the
Upleatham woods. Though but a speck in the landscape, it
has contributed more to history than places which boast acres
of houses. &#x201c;From this little nook of Cleveland,&#x201d; says the
local historian, &#x201c;sprang mighty monarchs, queens, high-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>chancellors,
archbishops, earls, barons, ambassadors, and
knights, and, above all, one brilliant and immortal name&mdash;Robert
Bruce.&#x201d; We hear of a Robert de Brus, second of the
name, trying to dissuade David of Scotland from awaiting the
attack of the English army near Northallerton: but the king
chose to fight, and lost, as we have already read, the Battle of
the Standard. And the sixth baron, Peter de Brus, was one
of the resolute band who made his mark at Runnymede, and
helped to wrest the right of Liberty from a royal craven.</p>

<p>Then taking a stride to later years, we find the author of
<i>Crazy Tales</i>, John Hall Stephenson, the occupant of Skelton
Castle, an esquire hospitable and eccentric, the Eugenius of
Sterne, who was his willing guest:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;In this retreat, whilom so sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once Tristram and his cousin dwelt.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There it was that Sterne bribed a boy to tie the weathercock
with its point to the west, hoping thereby to lure the host
from his chamber; for Eugenius would never leave his bed
while the wind blew from the east, even though good company
longed for his presence.</p>

<p>In one of his poems the &#x201c;crazy&#x201d; author describes the hill
country such as we see it stretching away beyond Cook&#x2019;s
monument:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Where the beholder stands confounded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At such a scene of mountains bleak;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Except some solitary pewit,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And carrion crows,<br /></span>

<p>On Eston Nab, that bold hill between us and the Tees, is
an ancient camp, and graves supposed to be two thousand years
old. Kildale, in the opposite direction, had once a diabolical
notoriety; for there the devil played many a prank, and drank
the church-well dry, so that the priest could get no holy water.
Ingleby Manor, an antique Tudor house, belonged to the
Foulis family, who gave a noteworthy captain to the army of
the Parliament. And other historic names&mdash;the D&#x2019;Arcys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Eures, Percys, and Baliols&mdash;all had estates overlooked by
Rosebury. Wilton Castle, not far from the foot of Eston
Nab, was built by Sir John Lowther, about fifty years ago, on
the site of a fortress once held by the Bulmers.</p>

<p>Now to return for a moment to the hill itself: the topmost
rocks are of the same formation as those we saw stretching
into the sea at Redcar, uptilted more than a thousand feet in
a distance of ten miles. And lower down, as if to exemplify
the geology of the North Riding in one spot, a thick stratum
of alum-rock is found, with ironstone, limestone, jet and coal,
and numerous fossil shells. And it illustrates meteorological
phenomena, for, from time immemorial, weatherwise folk have
said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;When Rosebury Topping wears a cap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Cleveland then beware a clap.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>More than an hour slipped away while I lounged and
loitered, making the round of the summit again and again, till
it seemed that the landscape had become familiar to me.
Then the solitude was broken by the arrival of strangers, who
came scrambling up the hill, encouraging one another, with
cheerful voices. They gained the rocks at last, panting; two
families from Middlesborough, husbands, wives, boys and girls,
and a baby, with plenty to eat and drink in their baskets,
come from the murky town to pass the Sunday on the breezy
hill-top. How they enjoyed the pure air and the wide
prospect; and how they wondered to find room for a camp-meeting
on a summit which, from their homes, looked as if it
were only a blunt point! They told me that a trip to
Rosebury Topping was an especial recreation for the people of
Middlesborough&mdash;a town which, by the way, is built on a
swampy site, where the only redeeming feature is ready access
to a navigable river. I remember what it was before the
houses were built. A drearier spot could not be imagined:
one of those places which, as <i>Punch</i> says, &#x201c;you want never to
hear of, and hope never to see.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis frightful to see how fast the graves do grow up in the
new cemetery,&#x201d; said one of the women, whose glad surprise
at the contrast between her home and her holiday could hardly
express itself in words. &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be a healthy place to bring
up a family in. That&#x2019;s where we live, is it&mdash;down there,
under all that smoke? Ah! if we could only come up here
every day!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>&#x201d;</p>

<p>Middlesborough, as we can see from far off, is now a large
town, numbering nearly 8000 inhabitants in 1851, and owes
its sudden growth to coal and iron. There the smelting
furnaces, roaring night and day, convert hundreds of tons of
the Cleveland hills every week into tons of marketable iron.
The quantity produced in 1856 in the Cleveland district was
180,000 tons. And there is the terminus of the &#x201c;Quakers&#x2019;
Railway;&#x201d; a dock, of nine acres, where vessels can load at all
times of the tide; an ingenious system of drops for the coal;
branch railways running in all directions; and a great level
of fifteen acres, on which three thousand wagons can stand at
once.</p>

<p>I stayed two hours on the hill-top, then taking a direct
line down the steepest side, now sliding, now rolling, very few
minutes brought me to the village of Newton at the foot. With
so sudden a change, the heat below seemed at first overpowering.
In the public-house, which scrupled not to open its door
to a traveller, I found half a dozen miners, who had walked over
from a neighbouring village to drink their pint without molestation.
Each recommended a different route whereby the ten
miles to Stockton might be shortened. One insisted on a cut
across the fields to Nunth<i>ar</i>p.</p>

<p>My ear caught at the sharp twang of the <i>ar</i>&mdash;a Yorkshire
man would have said Nunthurp&mdash;and turning to the speaker
I said, &#x201c;Surely that&#x2019;s Berkshire?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Ees, &#x2019;tis. I comes not fur from Read&#x2019;n&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p>

<p>True enough. Tempted by high wages in the north, he
had wandered from the neighbourhood of <i>Our Village</i> up to
the iron-diggings of Cleveland. I took it for granted that, as
he earned more than twice as much as he did at home, he
saved in proportion. But no; he didn&#x2019;t know how &#x2019;twas;
the money went somehow. Any way he didn&#x2019;t save a fardin&#x2019;
more than he did in Berkshire. I ventured to reply that
there was little good in earning more if one did not save more,
when a tall brawny fellow broke in with, &#x201c;Look here, lad.
I&#x2019;d ruther &#x2019;arn fifty shillin&#x2019;s a week and fling &#x2019;em right off
into that pond there, than &#x2019;arn fifteen to keep.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Just the retort that was to be expected under the circumstances.
It embodies a touch of proud sentiment in which
we can all participate.</p>

<p>I found the short cut to Nunthorp, struck there the high
road, and came in another hour to Marton&mdash;the birthplace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Cook. It is a small village with a modernised church, and a
few noble limes overshadowing the graves. The house where
the circumnavigator was born was little better than a clay
hovel of two rooms. It has long since disappeared; but the
field on which it stood is still called &#x201c;Cook&#x2019;s Garth.&#x201d; The
parish register contains an entry under the date November 3rd,
1728: &#x201c;James, ye son of James Cook, day-labourer, baptized.&#x201d;
The name of Mary Walker, aged 89, appears on one of the
stones in the churchyard; she it was who taught the day-labourer&#x2019;s
son to read while he was in her service, and who
has been mistakenly described as Dame Walker the schoolmistress.</p>

<p>I caught the evening train at Stockton, which travelling up
the Durham side of the Tees&mdash;past Yarm, where Havelock&#x2019;s
mother was born&mdash;past the &#x201c;hell kettles&#x201d; and Dinsdale Spa,
where drinking the water turns all the silver yellow in your
pockets&mdash;and so to Darlington, where I stayed for the night.</p>

<p>Facing the entrance to the railway station, elevated on a
pedestal of masonry, stands the first locomotive&mdash;<i>Number
One</i>. With such machines as that did the Quakers begin in
1823 to transport coal from the mines near Darlington to
Middlesborough along their newly-opened railway. Compared
with the snorting giants of the Great Western, its
form and dimensions are small and simple. No glittering
brass or polished steel bedeck its strength; it is nothing but
a black boiler, mounted on wheels, with three or four slender
working-rods standing up near one end, and the chimney
with its saw-toothed top at the other. Yet, common as it
looks, it is one of George Stephenson&#x2019;s early triumphs: one
of the steps by which he, and others after him, established
more and more the supremacy of mind over mere brute
matter. It was a happy thought to preserve <i>Number One</i> on
the spot where enlightened enterprise first developed its
capabilities.</p>

<p>Tees is one of those streams&mdash;the &#x201c;silly few&#x201d;&mdash;which owe
a divided allegiance, watering two counties at once. Rising
high amidst the wildest hills of the north-west, it takes a
course of eighty-three miles to the sea through many scenes
of romantic beauty. Yesterday we looked down from Rosebury
on the last two or three leagues of its outfall; to-day
if all go well we shall see the summit from which it springs.
It is a glorious morning; the earliest train arrives, interrupts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
our examination of the old locomotive, and away we go to
breakfast at Barnard Castle, on the Durham side of the
river.</p>

<p>There is so much of beautiful and interesting in the neighbourhood,
scenes made classic by the pen of Scott, that I
chose to pass the day in rambling, and journey farther in the
evening. The town itself, old-fashioned in aspect, quiet
enough for grass to grow here and there in the streets, was
one of the ancient border-towns, and paid the penalty of its
position. It has a curious market-cross, and touches of antiquity
in the byeways; and owing to something in its former
habits or history, is a butt for popular wit. &#x201c;Barney-Cassel,
the last place that God made,&#x201d; is one way of mentioning the
town by folk in other parts of the county; if you meet with
a fellow more uncouth than usual, he is &#x201c;Barney-Cassel
bred;&#x201d; any one who shoots with the long bow is silenced
with &#x201c;That wunna do, that&#x2019;s Barney-Cassel;&#x201d; and as Barney-Cassel
farmers may be recognised by the holes in their sacks,
so may the women by holes in their stockings.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning, a farmer, while on his way to chapel,
noticed a fine calf in his neighbour&#x2019;s field, and when seated
in his pew, was overheard to ask the owner of the animal,
&#x201c;Tommy, supposin&#x2019; it was Monday, what wad ye tak&#x2019; for yer
calf?&#x201d; To which Tommy replied in an equally audible
whisper, &#x201c;Why, supposin&#x2019; it was Monday, aw&#x2019;d tak&#x2019; two
pun&#x2019; fifteen.&#x201d; &#x201c;Supposin&#x2019; it was Monday aw&#x2019;ll gie two pun&#x2019;
ten.&#x201d; &#x201c;Supposin&#x2019; it was Monday, then ye shall hev&#x2019;t.&#x201d;
And the next day the calf was delivered to the scrupulous
purchaser.</p>

<p>The pride of the town is the castle&mdash;ruined remains of the
stronghold erected by Bernard Baliol to protect the lands
bestowed on him by William the Red. Seen from the bridge,
the rocky height, broken and craggy, and hung with wood,
crowned by Baliol&#x2019;s Tower, is remarkably picturesque. The
Tees sweeps round the base, as if impatient to hide itself
once more under green woods, to receive once more such
intermingled shadows of rock and leafage as fell on it through
Marwood Chase, and where Balder rushes in about a league
above. A mile of sunlight, and then the brawling stream
will play with the big stones and crowd its bed all through
the woods of Rokeby.</p>

<p>Let us mount the hill and ascend the tower. The bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
hermit who inhabits therein points the way to the stone stair
constructed within the massive wall, and presently we come
to the top, where, although there is no parapet, the great
thickness admits of your walking round in safety. The view
is a feast for the eye&mdash;thick woods marking the course of the
river, the trees thinning off as they meet the uplands, where
fields and hedgerows diversify the landscape away to the hills;
while in the distance the sight of dark, solemn moorlands
serves but to heighten the nearer beauty. We can see lands
once held by King Canute, now the property of the Duke of
Cleveland: we passed his estate, the park and castle of Raby,
about six miles distant on our way hither; and whichever
way we look there is something for memory to linger on:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Staindrop, who, from her sylvan bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salutes proud Raby&#x2019;s battled towers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rural brook of Egliston,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Balder, named from Odin&#x2019;s son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Greta, to whose banks ere long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We lead the lovers of the song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silver Lune, from Stanmore wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fairy Thorsgill&#x2019;s murmuring child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last and least, but loveliest still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Romantic Deepdale&#x2019;s slender rill.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Barnard Castle was lost to the Baliol family by the defeat
of John Baliol&#x2019;s pretensions to the crown of Scotland. Later
it was granted, with the adjoining estates, to the Earls of
Warwick, and on the marriage of Anne Neville with royal
Gloucester, the Duke chose it as his favourite residence.
You may still see his cognizance of the boar here and there on
the walls, and on some of the oldest houses in the town. The
Earl of Westmoreland had it next, but lost it by taking part
in <i>The Rising of the North</i>. The couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Coward, a coward, of Barney Castel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare not come out to fight a battel,&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is said to have its origin in the refusal of the knight who
held the castle, to quit the shelter of its walls and try the
effect of a combat with the rebels. And so the game went
on, the Crown resuming possession at pleasure, until the
whole property fell by purchase, in 1629, to an ancestor of
the present owner&mdash;the Duke of Cleveland.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Whoy! &#x2019;tis but a little town to ha&#x2019; such a muckle castle,&#x201d;
exclaimed one of three men who had just arrived with a
numerous party by excursion train from Newcastle, and ven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>tured
to the top of the tower. &#x201c;Eh! the castle wur bigger
nor the town.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Whatever may have been, the thick-voiced Northumbrian
was wrong in his first conclusion, for the town has more than
four thousand inhabitants. But, looking down, we can see
that the castle with its outworks and inner buildings must
have been a fortress of no ordinary dimensions. Nearly
seven acres are comprehended within its area, now chiefly
laid out in gardens, where, sheltered by the old gray stones,
the trees bear generous fruit. If you can persuade the
hermit to ascend, he will point out Brackenbury&#x2019;s Tower, a
dilapidated relic, with dungeons in its base, now used as
stables; and near it a cow-stall, which occupies the site of
the chapel. Examine the place when you descend, and you
will discover, amid much disfigurement, traces of graceful
architecture.</p>

<p>The hermit himself&mdash;a man of middle age&mdash;is a subject
for curiosity. So far as I could make him out, he appeared
to be half misanthropist, half misogynist. He quarrelled
with the world about eighteen years ago, and, without asking
leave, took possession of a vault and a wall-cavity at the foot
of the great round tower, and has lived there ever since,
supporting himself by the donations of visitors, and the sale
of rustic furniture which he makes with his own hands. His
room in the wall is fitted with specimens of his skill, and it
serves as a trap, for you have to pass through it to ascend the
tower. He showed me his workshop, and pointed out a spot
under the trees at the hill-foot where flows the clear cold
spring from which he draws water. The Duke, he said,
sometimes came to look at the ruin, and gave him a hint to
quit; but he did not mean to leave until absolutely compelled.
I heard later in the day that he had been crossed in
love; and that, notwithstanding his love of solitude, he would
go out at times and find a friend, and make a night of it.
But this may be scandal.</p>

<p>I went down and took a drink at the spring which, embowered
by trees and bushes, sparkles forth from the rocky
brink of the river; and rambled away to Rokeby. There
are paths on both sides of the stream, along the edge of the
meadows, and under the trees past the mill, past cottages and
gardens, leading farther and farther into scenes of increasing
beauty. Then we come to the Abbey Bridge, whence you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
get a pleasing view of a long straight reach of the river,
terminated by a glimpse of Rokeby Hall, a charming avenue,
so to speak, of tall woods, which, with ferns, shrubs, and
mazy plants, crowd the rocky slopes to the very edge of the
water. From ledge to ledge rushes the stream, making
falls innumerable, decked with living fringes of foam, and as
the noisy current hurries onward it engirdles the boulders with
foamy rings, or hangs upon them a long white train that flutters
and glistens as sunbeams drop down through the wind-shaken
leaves. Strong contrasts of colour enrich the effect:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Here Tees, full many a fathom low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wears with his rage no common foe;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O&#x2019;er solid sheets of marble gray.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the Yorkshire side, a few yards above the bridge, the
remains of Egliston or Athelstan Abbey crown a pleasant
knoll surrounded by wood. They are of small extent, and,
on the whole, deficient in the picturesque; but as an artist
said who sketched while his wife sat sewing by his side,
&#x201c;There are a few little bits worth carrying away.&#x201d; The east
window, in which the plain mullions still remain, is of unusual
width, the chancel exhibits carvings of different styles;
two or three slabs lying on the grass preserve the memory of
an abbot, and of a Rokeby, who figures in the still legible inscription
as <span class="blackletter">Bastard</span>; and the outbuildings are now occupied
as a farm. Some years hence, when the ivy, which has begun
to embrace the eastern window, shall have spread its evergreen
mantle wider and higher, the ruins will be endowed with a
charm wherein their present scanty nakedness may be concealed.
Yet apart from this the place has natural attractions, a village
green, noble trees, Thorsgill within sight; and just beyond
the green a mill of cheerful clatter.</p>

<p>The artist and his wife were enjoying a happy holiday.
They had come down into Yorkshire with a fortnight&#x2019;s excursion
ticket, and a scheme for visiting as many of the
abbeys and as much picturesque scenery as possible within the
allotted time. Sometimes they walked eight or ten miles, or
travelled a stage in a country car, content to rough it, so that
their wishes should be gratified. They had walked across
from Stainmoor the day before, and told me that in passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
through Bowes they had seen the original of Dotheboys Hall,
now doorless, windowless, and dilapidated. Nicholas Nickleby&#x2019;s
exposure was too much for it, and it ceased to be a den
of hopeless childhood&mdash;a place to which heartless fathers and
mothers condemned their children because it was cheap.</p>

<p>What a contrast! Wackford Squeers and the Thracian
cohort. Bowes, under the name of Lavatræ, was once a station
on the great Roman road from Lincoln to Carlisle. Ere
long it will be a station on the railway that is to connect
Stockton with Liverpool.</p>

<p>Now, returning to the bridge, we plunge into the woods,
and follow the river&#x2019;s course by devious paths. Gladsome
voices and merry laughter resound, for a numerous detachment
of the excursionists from Newcastle are on their way to
view the grounds of Rokeby. Delightful are the snatches of
river scenery that we get here and there, where the jutting
rock affords an outlook, and the more so as we enjoy them
under a cool green shade. Leaving the Northumbrians at the
lodge to accomplish their wishes, I kept on to Greta Bridge,
and lost myself in the romantic glen through which the river
flows. It will surprise you by its manifold combinations of
rock, wood, and water, fascinating the eye at every step amid
a solitude profound. This was the route taken by Bertram
and Wilfrid when the ruthless soldier went to take possession
of Mortham. You cannot fail to recognize how truly Scott
describes the scenery; the &#x201c;beetling brow&#x201d; is there, and the
&#x201c;ivied banners&#x201d; still hang from the crags as when the minstrel
saw them. We can follow the two to that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;&mdash;&mdash;grassy slope which sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Greta flow to meet the Tees:&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and farther, where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;South of the gate, an arrow flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two mighty elms their limbs unite,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>You will long to lengthen your hours into days for wanderings
in this lovely neighbourhood. You will be unwilling to
turn from the view at Mortham Tower&mdash;one of the old border
peels, or fortresses on a small scale&mdash;or that which charms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
you from the Dairy Bridge. Then if the risk of losing your
way does not deter, you may ramble to &#x201c;Brignall Banks&#x201d;
and Scargill, having the river for companion most part of the
way. And should you be minded to pursue the road through
Richmondshire to Richmond, the village and ruins of Ravensworth
will remind you of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;The Baron of Ravensworth prances in pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he views his domains upon Arkindale side.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The chase for the wild, and the park for the tame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the fish of the lake, and the door of the vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are less free to Lord Dacre than Allen-a-Dale!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or, if inspired by a deeper sentiment, you prefer a pilgrimage
to a spot of hallowed memory to every Englishman, choose
the river-side path to Wycliffe, and see how ever new beauties
enchant the way, and say on arrival if ever you saw a prettier
village church or a more charming environment. Shut in by
woods and hills here, as some writers show, is the birthplace
of John Wycliffe, to whom freedom of conscience is perhaps
more indebted than to Luther. One may believe that Nature
herself desires to preserve from desecration the cradle of him
who opened men&#x2019;s hearts and eyes to see and understand the
truth in its purity; cleansed from the adulterations of priestcraft;
stripped of all the blinding cheats of papistry; who
died faithful to the truth for which he had dared to live; who
bequeathed that truth to us, and with God&#x2019;s blessing we will
keep it alive and unblemished, using it manfully as a testimony
against all lies and shams whatsoever and wheresoever they
may be found.</p>

<p>The church was restored, as one may judge, in a loving
spirit in 1850. It contains a few interesting antiquities, and
is fraught with memories of the Wycliffes. One of the
brasses records the death of the last of the family. Sir Antonio
a-More&#x2019;s portrait of the great Reformer still hangs in the
rectory, where it has been treasured for many generations.</p>

<p>You may return from this pilgrimage by the way you went,
or walk on through Ovington to Winston, and there take the
train to Barnard Castle. I preferred the banks of Tees, for
their attractions are not soon exhausted. One of the houses at
Greta, which was a famous hostelry in the days of stage-coaches,
is now a not happy-looking farm-house. It has seen
sore changes. Once noise and activity, and unscrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
profits, when the compact vehicles with the four panting
horses rattled up to the door at all hours of the day or night,
conveying passengers from London to Edinburgh. Now, a
silence seldom disturbed save by the river&#x2019;s voice, and time for
reflection, and leisure to look across to its neighbour, wherein
the wayfarer or angler may still find rest and entertainment.
From Greta Bridge to Boroughbridge was considered the best
bit of road in all the county. Now it is encroached on by
grass, and the inns which are not shut up look altogether dejected,
especially that one where the dining-room has been
converted into a stable.</p>

<p>If you have read the ballad of <i>The Felon Sow</i>, we will
remember it while repassing the park:</p>

<p>I got back to Barnard Castle in time for the omnibus, which
starts at half-past five for Middleton-in-Teesdale, nine miles
distant on the road to the hills. I was the only passenger,
and taking my seat by the side of the driver, found him very
willing to talk. The road ascends immediately after crossing
the bridge to a finely-wooded district, hill and dale, rich in
oak, ash, and beech. Deepdale beck yawns on the left, and
every mile opens fresh enjoyment to the eye, and revives
associations. Lartington is a pretty village, which hears night
and morn and all day long the tremulous voice of innumerable
leaves. &#x201c;Them&#x2019;s all Roman Catholics there,&#x201d; said the driver,
as we left it behind; and by-and-by, when we came to Cotherstone&mdash;Cuthbert&#x2019;s
Town&mdash;&#x201c;Here &#x2019;tis nothin&#x2019; but cheese and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Quakers.&#x201d; There is, however, something else, for here it was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;&mdash;&mdash;the Northmen came,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And gave the dell the Thunderer&#x2019;s name.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A delightful day might be spent hereabouts in exploring
the glen of the Balder, and the romantic scenery where it
flows into Tees; the Hagg crowned by fragments of a stronghold
of the Fitzhughs; and the grand rock on the river&#x2019;s
brink known as Pendragon Castle. The whole region for
miles around was once thickly covered by forest.</p>

<p>The pace is sober, for some of the hills are steep. We
come to Romaldkirk, and the folk, as everywhere else along
the road, step from their houses to inquire for parcels or
replies to messages, and the driver has a civil word for all,
and discharges his commissions promptly. He is an important
man in the dale, the roving link between the villagers and
the town&mdash;&#x201c;Barn&#x2019;d Cas&#x2019;l&#x2019;,&#x201d; as they say, slurring it into two
syllables. It does one good to see with how much good-nature
the service can be performed.</p>

<p>Hill after hill succeeds, the woods are left behind, the
country opens bare and wild, rolling away to the dark fells
that look stern in the distance. Big stones bestrew the slopes;
here and there a cottage seems little better than a pile of such
stones covered with slabs of slate or coarse thatch. &#x201c;Poorish
wheat hereabouts,&#x201d; says the driver, as he points to the pale green
fields. The farms vary in size from seventy to one hundred
and fifty acres; and he thinks it better to grow grass than grain.
Then we come in sight of Middleton, and presently he pulls
up, while a boy and girl get inside, and he tells me they are
his children, who have come out half a mile to meet him.</p>

<p>Middleton, with its eighteen hundred inhabitants, has the
appearance of a little metropolis. There are inns and shops
which betoken an active trade, maintained probably by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
lead mines in the neighbourhood. I did not tarry, for we had
spent two hours on the journey, and I wished to sleep at the
<i>High Force Inn</i>, nearly five miles farther. We are still on the
Durham side of the Tees, with the river now in sight, winding
along its shallow, stony bed. The road is an almost continuous
ascent, whereby the landscape appears to widen, and
every minute the shadows grow broader and darker across the
vale. At last the sun drops behind the hill-top, and the lights
playing on the summits of the fells deepen into purple,
umber, and black, darkest where the slopes and ridges intersect.
Cliffs topped with wood break through the acclivities on the
left, and here and there plantations of spruce and larch
impart a sense of shelter. Every step makes us feel that we
are approaching a region where Nature partakes more of the
stern than the gentle.</p>

<p>There is room for improvement. I interrupted three boys
in their pastime of pelting swallows, to examine them in
reading; but they only went &#x201c;whiles to skule,&#x201d; and only
one could read, and that very badly, in the &#x201c;Testyment.&#x201d;</p>

<p>I left Winch Bridge and the cascade which it bestrides
about three miles from Middleton, unvisited, for I was tired
with much rambling. The clean white front of <i>High Force
Inn</i> gleaming at last through the twilight was a welcome sight;
and not less so the excellent tea, which was quickly set before
me. Cleanliness prevails, and unaffected civility; and the
larder, though in a lone spot a thousand feet above the sea,
contributes without stint to the hungry appetite.</p>

<p>It happened that I was the only guest: hence nothing
disturbed the tranquil hour. Ere long I was looking from my
chamber window on the dim outlines of the hills, and the thick
wood below that intercepts the view of the valley beneath.
Then I became aware of a solemn roar&mdash;the voice of High
Force in its ceaseless plunge. Fitfully it came at times, now
fuller, now weaker, as the night breeze rose and fell, and the
tree-tops whispered in harmony therewith.</p>

<p>I listened awhile, sensible of a charm in the sound of
falling water; then pushing the sash to its full height, the
sound still reached me on the pillow. Strange fancies came
with it: now the river seemed to utter sonorous words; anon
the hills talked dreamily one with another, and the distant sea
sent up a reply; and then all became vague&mdash;and I slept the
sleep of the weary.</p>

<p>The next day dawned, and a happy awaking was mine,
greeted by the same rushing voice, no longer solemn and
mysterious, but chanting, as one might imagine, a morning
song of praise. I looked out, and saw with pleasurable
surprise the fall full in view from the window: a long white
sheet of foam, glistening in the early sunbeams.</p>

<p>All the slope between the inn and the fall is covered by a
thick plantation of firs, ash, hazel, and a teeming undergrowth,
and through this by paths winding hither and thither
you have to descend. Now the path skirts precipitous rocks,
hung with ivy, now drops gently among ferns to an embowered
seat, until at a sudden turn the noise of the fall bursts grandly
upon you. A little farther, and the trees no longer screening,
you see the deep stony chasm, and the peat-stained water
making three perpendicular leaps down a precipice seventy
feet in height. It is a striking scene, what with the grim
crags, the wild slopes, and the huge masses lying at the
bottom and in the bed of the stream; and the impressive
volume of sound.</p>

<p>We can scramble down to the very foot of the limestone
bluff that projects in the middle, leaving a channel on each
side, down one of which a mere thread of water trickles; but
in time of flood both are filled, and then the fall is seen and
heard in perfection. Now we can examine the smooth water-worn
cliff, and see where something like crystallization has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
been produced by a highly-heated intrusive rock. And here
and there your eye will rest with pleasure on patches of
moss and fern growing luxuriantly in dripping nooks and
crannies.</p>

<p>You see how the water, rebounding from its second plunge,
shoots in a broken mass of foam into the brown pool below,
and therein swirls and swashes for a while, and then escapes
by an outlet that you might leap across, talking to thousands
of stones as it spreads itself out in the shallow bed. Standing
with your back to the fall, and looking down the stream, the
view, shut in by the trees on one side, by a rough grassy
acclivity on the other, is one that lures you to explore it,
striding along the rugged margin, or from one lump of rock
to another.</p>

<p>Then returning to the diverging point in the path, we
mount to the top of the fall. Here the scene is, if possible,
wilder than below. The rock, as far as you can see, is split
into a thousand crevices, and through these the river rushes to
its leap. Such a river-bed you never saw before. The solid
uprising portions are of all dimensions, and you step from one
to the other without first feeling if they are steady. Here
and there you climb, and coming to the top of the bluff you
can look over and watch the water in its headlong plunge. The
brown tinge contrasts beautifully with the white foam; and
lying stretched on the sun-warmed rock, your eye becomes
fascinated by the swift motion and the dancing spray. Then
sit awhile on the topmost point and look up stream, and
enjoy the sight of the rapids, and the multitudinous cascades.
Though the rocks now lift their heads above water you will
notice that all are smoothly worn by the floods of ages. The
view is bounded there by a mighty high-backed fell; and in
the other direction brown moorlands meet the horizon, all
looking glad in the glorious sunshine.</p>

<p>I loitered away two hours around the fall in unbroken solitude,
and returned to the inn to breakfast before all the dew
was dry. The house was built about twenty-five years ago,
said the waitress, when the road was made to connect the lead
mines of Alston Moor, in Cumberland, with the highways of
Durham. There was not much traffic in the winter, for then
nobody travelled but those who were compelled&mdash;farmers,
cattle-dealers, and miners; but in summer the place was kept
alive by numerous visitors to the fall. Most were contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
with a sight of High Force; but others went farther, and
looked at Caldron Snout and High Cope Nick. Sometimes a
school came up for a day&#x2019;s holiday; they had entertained one
the day before&mdash;two wagon-loads of Roman Catholic children.
True enough, our omnibus had met them returning.</p>

<p>The house looks across the valley to Holwick Fell, and
were it not for the trees in front, would have but a bare and,
at times, desolate prospect. The whole premises are as clean
as whitewash can make them; even the stone fences are
whitewashed. The Duke of Cleveland is proprietor: he
ought to be proud of his tenants.</p>

<p>How glad the morning seemed when I stepped forth again
into the sunshine to travel a few miles farther up the Tees.
The road still ascends and curves into the bleak and lonely
fells, which stretch across the west of Durham and into
Cumberland. In winter they are howling wastes, and in
snow-storms appalling, as I remember from painful experience.
But in summer there is a monotonous grandeur about
them comparable only with that of the ocean.</p>

<p>Just beyond the sixteenth milestone from Alston I got over
the fence, and followed a path edging away on the left towards
the river. It crosses pastures, little meadows, coarse swampy
patches sprinkled with flowers; disappears in places; but
while you can see the river or a cottage you need not go
astray. There is something about the cottages peculiar to a
hill-country: the ground-floor is used as a barn and stable,
and the dwelling-rooms are above, approached by a stone stair
on the outside. With their walls freshly whitewashed, they
appear as bright specks widely scattered in the wilderness;
and though no tree adorns or shelters them, they betoken the
presence of humanity, and there is comfort in that. And
withal they enjoy the purest breezes, the most sparkling
water, flowery meadows, and hills purple with heather when
summer is over. If you go to the door the inmates will
invite you to sit, and listen eagerly to the news you bring.
Meanwhile you may note the evidences of homely comfort
and apparent contentment. A girl who was pulling dock-leaves&mdash;&#x201c;dockans,&#x201d;
as she called them&mdash;told me they were
to be boiled for the pig.</p>

<p>Ere long Cronkley Scar comes in sight&mdash;a tremendous
sombre precipice of the rock known to geologists as greenstone,
in which, if learned in such matters, you may peruse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
many examples of metamorphic phenomena. And hereabouts,
as botanists tell us, there are rare and interesting plants to be
discovered. The Scar is on the Yorkshire side; but the
stream is here so shallow and full of stones, that to wade
across would only be an agreeable footbath.</p>

<p>Now the stream makes a bend between two hills, and looking
up the vale we see the lower slopes of Mickle Fell&mdash;the
highest mountain in Yorkshire. We shall perhaps climb to
its summit ere the day be many hours older.</p>

<p>From the last dwelling&mdash;a farm-house&mdash;I mounted the hill,
and followed a course by compass to hit the river above the
bend. Soon all signs of habitation were left behind, and the
trackless moorland lay before me, overspread with a dense
growth of ling, wearisome to walk through. And how silent!
A faint sound of rushing water comes borne on the breeze,
and that is all.</p>

<p>Then we come to the declivity, and the view opens to the
north-west, swell beyond swell, each wilder in aspect, as it
seems, than the other. And there beneath us glisten the
shining curves of the Tees. The compass has not misled us, and
we descend to the Weel, as this part of the river is called,
where for about a mile its channel deepens, and the current is
so tranquil that you might fancy it a lengthened pool. We
go no higher, but after gazing towards the fells in which the
river draws its source, we turn and follow the Weel to a rift
in the hill-side. The current quickens, the faint sound grows
louder, and presently coming to the brink of a rocky chasm
we behold the cataract of Caldron Snout. The Tees here
makes a plunge of two hundred feet, dashing from rock to
rock, twisting, whirling, eddying, and roaring in its dark and
tortuous channel. The foam appears the whiter, and the
grass all the greener, by contrast with the blackness of the
riven crags, and although no single plunge equals that at
High Force, you will perhaps be more impressed here. You
are here shut out from the world amid scenes of savage beauty,
and the sense of isolation begets a profounder admiration of
the natural scene, and enjoyment of the manifold watery
leaps, as you pause at each while scrambling down the
hill-side.</p>

<p>About half-way down the fall is crossed by a bridge&mdash;a
rough beam only, with a rude hand-rail&mdash;from which you can
see the fall in either direction and note the stony bends of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the river below till they disappear behind the hill. From
near its source to Caldron the Tees divides Durham from
Westmoreland, and in all its further downward course from
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Let me sit for an hour by the side of a fall, and watch the
swift play of the water, and hear its ceaseless splash and roar,
and whatever cobwebs may have gathered in my mind, from
whatever cause, are all swept clean away. Serenity comes
into my heart, and the calm sunshine pervades my existence
for months&mdash;nay, years afterwards. And what a joy it is to
recall&mdash;especially in a London November&mdash;or rather to renew,
the happy mood inspired by the waterfall among the mountains!</p>

<p>I have at times fancied that the effect of the noise is somewhat
similar to that described of narcotics by those who
indulge therein. The mind forgets the body, and thinks whatsoever
it listeth. Whether or not, my most various and vivid
day-dreams have been dreamt by the side of a waterfall.</p>

<p>It seems, moreover, at such times, as if memory liked to
ransack her old stores. And now I suddenly recollected
Hawkeye&#x2019;s description of the tumbling water at Glenn&#x2019;s Falls,
as narrated in <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, which I had read when
a boy. Turn to the page, reader, and you will admire its faithfulness.
Anon came a rhyme which a traveller who went to
see the falls of the Clyde sixty years ago, tells us he copied
from the album at Lanark:</p>

<p>Southey, who read everything, perhaps saw this before he

<p>And we, too, must be gone; and now that we have seen</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>we will gather ourselves up and travel on.</p>

<p>But whither? I desired a public-house; but no house of
any sort was to be seen&mdash;nothing but the scrubby hill-side,
and mossy-headed rocks peeping out with a frown at the
mortal who had intruded into their dominion. The end of
a meadow, however, comes over the slope on the other side of
the bridge; perhaps from the top of the slope something may
be discerned. Yes, there was a cottage. I hastened thither,
but it proved to be an old tenement now used as a byre. I
looked farther, and, about a mile distant, saw two farm-houses.
The view had opened into Birkdale, and there, on the left,
rose the huge, long-backed form of Mickle Fell, whose topmost
height was my next aim, and I could test the hospitality of
the houses on the way thither.</p>

<p>We are now in a corner of Westmoreland which, traversed
by Birkdale, presents diversified alpine features. The valley
is green; the meadows are flowery and dotted with cattle; the
hills, stern and high, are browsed by sheep; and Maize Beck,
a talkative mountain stream, flows with many a stony bend
along the bottom&mdash;the dividing line between Westmoreland
and Yorkshire. There are no trees; and for miles wide the
only building is here and there a solitary byre.</p>

<p>My inquiry for dinner at the first of the two houses was
answered by an invitation to sit down, and ready service of
bread, butter, milk, and cheese. I made a capital repast, and
drank as much genuine milk at one sitting as would charge a
Londoner&#x2019;s supply for two months. The father was out sheep-shearing,
leaving the mother with a baby and four big children
at home. But only the eldest boy looked healthy; the others
had the sodden, unwashed appearance supposed to be peculiar
to dwellers in the alleys of large towns. No wonder, I thought,
for the kitchen, the one living room, was as hot and stifling as
a Bohemian cottage. The atmosphere was close and disagreeably
odorous; a great turf fire burned in the grate, and yet
the outer door was kept as carefully shut as if July breezes
were hurtful. I tried to make the good woman aware of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
ill consequences of bad air; but old habits are not to be
changed in an hour. She didn&#x2019;t think that overmuch wind
could do anybody good, and it was best for babies to keep them
warm. They managed to do without the doctor: only
fetched him when they must. There was none nearer than
Middleton. Six weeks previously, when baby was born, they
had to send for him in a hurry; but Tees was in flood, and
Caldron Snout so full that the water ran over the bridge; her
boy, however, got across, and rode away the nine miles at full
speed on his urgent errand.</p>

<p>What with chairs and tables, racks and shelves, the dresser,
the clock, the settee under the window, three dogs, a cat, and
a pigeon&mdash;to say nothing of the family&mdash;the room was almost
as crowded as the steerage of a ship. The pigeon&mdash;the only
one in the dale&mdash;had come from parts unknown a few weeks
before of its own accord, and was now a household pet, cooing
about the floor, and on civil terms with the cat. But the
children feared it would die in winter, as they had no peas
in those parts, nothing but grass. Sixty acres of &#x201c;mowing
grass&#x201d; and a run for sheep comprise the farm.</p>

<p>While the Ordnance Survey was in Westmoreland, two
sappers lodged in the house for months; and the eldest son,
an intelligent lad, had much to tell concerning their operations.
What pains they took; how many times they toiled to the top
of Mickle Fell only to find that up there it was too windy for
their observations, and so forth. Sometimes a stranger came
and wanted a guide to High Cope Nick, and then he went
with his father. Two photographers had come the preceding
autumn, and took views of the Nick on pieces of paper with
a box that had a round glass in it; but the views wasn&#x2019;t very
good ones.</p>

<p>High Cope Nick, as its name indicates, is a deep notch or
chasm in the hills overlooking the low country of Westmoreland
about four miles from this Birkdale farm. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nigh
hand as brant<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> as a wall,&#x201d; said the boy; &#x201c;you can hardly
stand on&#x2019;t.&#x201d; It is one of the scenes which I reserve for a
future holiday.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> Steep.</p></div>

<p>The woman could not hear of taking more than sixpence
for my dinner, and thought herself overpaid with that. The
two boys were going up the fell to look after sheep, so we
started together, crossed the beck on stepping-stones, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
by two dogs, and soon began the long ascent. There is no
path: you stride through the heather, through the tough bent,
across miry patches, and stony slopes, past swallow-holes
wherein streams of water disappear in heavy rains; and find
at times by the side of the beck a few yards of smooth sweet
turf. The beck is noisy in its freakish channel, yet pauses
here and there and fills a sober pool, wherein you may see fish,
and perchance a drowned sheep. I saw four on the way
upwards, and the sight of the swollen carcases made me defer
drinking till nearer the source. I could hardly believe the
lads&#x2019; word that fifteen hundred sheep were feeding on the hill,
so few did they appear scattered over the vast surface.</p>

<p>&#x201c;How many sheep do you consider fair stock to the acre?&#x201d;
asked Sir John Sinclair during one of his visits to the hills.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Eh! mun, ye begin at wrang end,&#x201d; was the answer. &#x201c;Ye
should ax how many acres till a sheep.&#x201d; Of such land as this
the North Riding contains four hundred thousand acres.</p>

<p>Besides the sheep, added the youth, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s thirty breeding
galloways on the hill. There&#x2019;s nothing pays better than
breeding galloways. You can sell the young ones a year or
year and a half old for eight pounds apiece, and there&#x2019;s no
much fash wi&#x2019; &#x2019;em.&#x201d;</p>

<p>When the time came to part, I sat down and tried to give
the boys a peep at their home through my telescope. But in
vain; they could distinguish nothing, see nothing but a haze
of green or brown. On the other hand, they could discern a
sheep or some moving object at a great distance which I could
not discover at all with the glass. They turned aside to their
flock, and I onwards up the hill. The beck had diminished
to a rill, and presently I came to its source&mdash;a delicious spring
bubbling from a rock, and took a quickening draught.</p>

<p>At length the acclivity becomes gentle, the horizon spreads
wider and wider, and we reach the cairn erected by the
sappers on the summit of Mickle Fell, 2580 feet above the
sea&mdash;the highest, as before remarked, of the Yorkshire mountains.
Glorious is the prospect! Hill and dale in seemingly
endless succession&mdash;there rolling away to the blue horizon,
here bounded by a height that hides all beyond. In the west
appears the great gathering of mountains which keep watch
over the Lake country, there Skiddaw, there Helvellyn, yonder
Langdale Pikes, and the Old Man of Coniston; summit after
summit, their outlines crossing and recrossing in picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
confusion. Conspicuous in the north Cross Fell&mdash;in which
spring the head-waters of Tees&mdash;heaves his brown back in
majestic sullenness some three hundred feet higher than the
shaggy brow we stand on. Hence you can trace the vale of Tees
for miles. Then gazing easterly, we catch far, far away the
Cleveland hills, and, following round the circle, the blue range
of the Hambletons, then Penyghent, Whernside, and Ingleborough,
with many others, bring us round once more to the
west. Again and again will your eye travel round the
glorious panorama.</p>

<p>Mickle Fell is one of the great summits in the range
described by geologists as the Pennine chain&mdash;the backbone of
England. Its outline is characteristic of that of the county;
bold and abrupt to the west; sloping gradually down to
the east. Hence the walk up from High Force or Birkdale
calls for no arduous climbing, it is only tedious. From the
western extremity you look down into the vale of the Eden,
where the green meadows, the broad fields of grain, dotted
with trees and bordered with hedgerows, appear the more
beautiful from contrast with the brown tints of the surrounding
hills.</p>

<p>Now for the descent. I scanned the great slope on the
south for a practicable route, and fixed beforehand on the
objects by which to direct my steps when down in the hollows&mdash;where
scant outlook is to be had. Lowest of all lies
what appears to be a light green meadow; beyond it rises
a Mickle Fell on a small scale: I will make my way to the
top of that, and there take a new departure. All between
is a wild expanse of rock and heather. A sober run soon
brought me to the edge of a beck, and keeping along its
margin, now on one side, now on the other, choosing the
firmest ground, I made good progress; and with better speed,
notwithstanding the windings, than through the tough close
heather. Every furlong the beck grows wider and fuller,
and here and there the banks curve to the form of an oval
basin smooth with short grass; favourite haunts for the sheep.
The silly creatures take to flight nimbly as goats at the appearance
of an intruder, and I lie down to enjoy the solitude.
The silence is oppressive&mdash;almost awful. Shut in already
by the huge hill-sides, I am still more hidden in this hollow.
The beck babbles; the fugitive sheep all unseen bleat
timidly; a curlew comes with its melancholy cry wheeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
round and round above my head; but the overwhelming
silence loses nothing of its force. At times a faint hollow
roar, as if an echo from the distant ocean, seems to fill all the
air for an instant, and die mysteriously away. It is a time to
commune with one&#x2019;s own heart and be still: to feel how poor are
artificial pleasures compared to those which are common to
all&mdash;the simplest, which can be had for nothing&mdash;namely, sunshine,
air, and running water, and the fair broad earth to walk
upon.</p>

<p>Onwards. The beck widens, and rushes into a broad stony
belt to join a stream hurrying down the vale from the west.
I crossed, and came presently to the supposed bright green
meadow. It was a swamp&mdash;a great sponge. To go round
it would be tedious: I kept straight on, and by striding from
one rushy hummock to another, though not without difficulty
in the middle, where the sponge was all but liquid, and the
rushes wide apart, I got across. Then the smaller hill began:
it was steep, and without a break in the heather, compelling
a toilsome climb. However, it induces wholesome exercise.
From the top I saw Stainmoor, and as I had anticipated, the
road which runs across it from Barnard Castle into Westmoreland.
I came down upon it about four miles from
Brough.</p>

<p>It is a wild region. A line of tall posts is set up along
the way, as in an alpine pass, suggestive of winter snows
deep and dangerous. By-and-by we come to a declivity, and
there far below we see the vale of Eden, and descend towards
it, the views continually changing with the windings of the
road. Then a hamlet, with children playing on the green,
and geese grazing among the clumps of gorse, and trees, and
cultivation; and all the while the hills appear to grow more
and more mountainous as we descend. Then Brough comes
in sight&mdash;the little hard-featured Westmoreland town&mdash;whitewashed
walls, blue slate roofs, the church a good way off on an
eminence, and beyond that, on a grassy bluff, the ruins of a
castle partly screened by trees.</p>

<p>I wanted rest and refreshment, and found both at the <i>Castle
Inn</i>. An hour later I strolled out to the ruin. The mount
on which it stands rises steeply from the Helbeck, a small
tributary of the Eden, and terminates precipitously towards
the west. The keep still rears itself proudly aloft, commanding
the shattered towers, the ancient gateway, the dismantled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
walls and broken stair, and the country for miles around.
Fallen masses lie partly buried in the earth, and here and there
above the rough stonework overhangs as if ready to follow.
While sauntering now within, now without, you can look
across the cultivated landscape, or to the town, and the great
slope of Helbeck Fell behind it; and you will perhaps deem
it a favourable spot to muse away the hour of sunset, when
the old pile is touched with golden light. Thick as the walls
are, Time and dilapidations have made them look picturesque.
One of the spoilers was William the Lion of Scotland, who
finding here a Norman fortress in 1174, took it, along with
other Westmoreland strongholds; and was taken himself in
the course of the same year at Alnwick. The Rey Cross on
Stainmoor&mdash;still a monumental site&mdash;marked the southern
limit of the Scottish principality of Cumberland; hence, the
hungry reivers north of Tweed had always an excuse for
crossing over to beat the bounds after their manner. Twice
afterwards was Brough Castle repaired, and burnt to a
shell. The second restoration was carried out in 1659 by the
Lady Anne Clifford, Countess Dowager of Pembroke, who
recorded the fact on a stone over the entrance, enumerating
all her titles, among which were &#x201c;High Sheriffess by inheritance
of the county of Westmoreland, and Lady of the Honour of
Skipton,&#x201d; and ending with a text of Scripture&mdash;Isaiah lviii,
12. After the last fire, whosoever would pillaged the castle; the
stone bearing the Countess&#x2019;s inscription was taken down, and
used in the repair of Brough mill, and the ruins became a
quarry, out of which were built sheds and cottages. The large
masses of masonry, which now lie embedded in the earth, fell
in 1792.</p>

<p>According to antiquaries the castle occupies the centre of
what had been a Roman station; for Brough was the ancient
Verteræ, where coins of the emperors have been dug up, and
the highway along which the legions marched to and from
Carlisle, or the Picts&#x2019; Wall, is still traceable, known in the
neighbourhood as the Maiden Way.</p>

<p>It was a lovely evening. The sun went down in splendour
behind the Cumbrian hills, and when the radiance faded from
the topmost summits, and gave place to dusky twilight, I went
back to mine inn.</p>

<p class="hangindent small">Return into Yorkshire&mdash;The Old Pedlar&mdash;Oh! for the Olden Time&mdash;&#x201c;The

Scar&mdash;Geological Phenomenon&mdash;A Frozen Cone&mdash;Hawes.</p>

<p>My next morning&#x2019;s route took me back into Yorkshire by a
way which, leaving the road to Kirkby Stephen on the right,
approaches Nine Standards, High Seat, and the other great
summits which guard the head of Swaledale. The sight of
these hills, and the gradual succession of cultivation and woods
by untilled slopes patched with gorse and bracken, impart an
interest to the walk. A modern battlemented edifice&mdash;Hougill
Castle&mdash;appears on the left, the residence of a retired
physician, and beyond it the wild region of Stainmoor Forest;
and here even upon its outskirts we can see how appropriate
is the name Stonymoor.</p>

<p>When near the hills I overtook an old pedlar, and slackened
my pace to have a talk with him. At times I had fancied my
knapsack, of less than ten pounds&#x2019; weight, a little too heavy;
but he, though aged sixty, carried a pack of forty pounds,
and when in his prime could have borne twice as much. He
took matters easily now; walked slowly and rested often.
From talking about schools, he began to contrast the present
time with the past. Things were not half so good now as in
the olden time, when monasteries all over the land took proper
care alike of religion and the poor. Where was there anything
like religion now-a-days, except among the Roman
Catholics? Without them England would be in a miserable
plight; but he took comfort, believing from certain signs that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the old days would return&mdash;that England would once more
acknowledge the supremacy of the Pope.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Never,&#x201d; I replied; &#x201c;that&#x2019;s not possible in a country
where the Bible circulates freely; and where all who will
may read it.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;The Bible!&#x201d; he answered sneeringly&mdash;&#x201c;the Bible!
What&#x2019;s the Bible? It&#x2019;s a very dangerous and improper book
for the people to read. What should they know about it?
The Church is the best judge. The Bible, indeed!&#x201d;</p>

<p>Such talk surprised me. I had heard that the Papists
employ emissaries of all degrees in the endeavour to propagate
their doctrines; but never met with one before who
spoke out his notions so unreservedly; and I could have
imagined myself thrown back some five hundred years, and
the old fellow to be the spokesman in the Somersetshire
ballad:</p>

</div></div>

<p>I began to defend the rights of conscience, when, as we
came to the foot of the first great hill, the old packman advised
me to reconsider my errors, bade me good day, and
turned into a cottage; perhaps to sell calico; perhaps to sow
tares for the keeper of the keys at Rome.</p>

<p>I made a cut-off, and came upon the road half way up the
hill, leaving sultriness for a breezy elevation. Soon wide
prospects opened all around me: vast green undulations,
dotted with sheep and geese, swelling up into the distant hills
and moorlands. That great group of heights on the right&mdash;Wild
Boar Fell and Shunnor Fell&mdash;wherein Nature displays
but few of her smiles, is the parent of not a few of Yorkshire&#x2019;s
dales, becks, and waterfalls. In those untrodden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
solitudes rise Swale and Ure; there lurks the spring from
which Eden bursts to flow through gloomy Mallerstang, and
transfer its allegiance, as we have seen, to other counties,
and the fairest of Cumbrian vales. Our topographical bard,
makes the forest of the darksome glen thus address the infant
stream:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">With love I bear to thee, the day cannot suffice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Mallerstang to gaze upon thy beauteous eyes.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Talk of royal tapestries, what carpet can compare with the
springy turf that borders the road whereon you walk with
lightsome step, happier than a king, and having countless
jewels to admire in the golden buds of the gorse? It is a
delightful mountain walk, now rising, now falling, but always
increasing the elevation; so cool and breezy in comparison
with the sultry temperature of the road we left below. And
the grouping of the summits around the broad expanse changes
slowly as you advance, and between the shades of yellow and
green, brown and purple, the darker shadows denote the
courses of the dales. Wayfarers are few; perhaps a boy
trudges past pulling a donkey, which drags a sledge laden
with turf or hay; or a pedlar with crockery; but for miles
your only living companions are sheep and geese.</p>

<p>With increasing height we have less of grass and more of
ling, and at ten miles from Brough we come to the public-house
on Tan Hill, situate in the midst of a desolate brown
upland, in which appear the upreared timbers of coalpits,
some abandoned, others in work. The house shows signs of
isolation in a want of cleanliness and order; but you can get
oaten bread, cheese, and passable beer, and have a talk with
the pitmen, and the rustics who come in for a drink ere starting
homewards with cartloads of coal. Seeing the numerous
family round the hostess, I inquired about their school; on
which one of the black fellows&mdash;a rough diamond&mdash;took up
the question. There had been a dame school in one of the
adjacent cottages, but the old &#x2019;oman gave it up, and now the
bairns was runnin&#x2019; wild. &#x2019;Twasn&#x2019;t right of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the
proprietor of the mines, to take away 5000<i>l.</i> a year, and not
give back some on&#x2019;t for a school. It made a man&#x2019;s heart sore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
to see bairns wantin&#x2019; schoolin&#x2019; and no yabble to get it.
&#x2019;Twasn&#x2019;t right, that &#x2019;t wasn&#x2019;t.</p>

<p>Apparently an honest miner lived beneath that coaly incrustation,
possessed of good sense and sensibility. I quite
agreed with him, and recommended him to talk about a school
whenever he could get a listener.</p>

<p>About a mile from the public-house the road leaves the
brown region, and descends rapidly to the Swale, crossing
where the stream swells in rainy weather to a noisy cataract,
and Swaledale stretches away before us, a grand mountain
valley, yet somewhat severe in aspect. Gentle, as its name
imports, appears misapplied to a rushing stream; but a long
course lies before it: past Grinton, past picturesque Richmond,
ancient ruins, towers of barons, and cloisters of monks, and to
the broad Vale of York, where, calmed by old experience, it
flows at Myton gently into the Ure. And not only gentle but
sacred, for Swale has been called the Jordan of Yorkshire,
because of the multitudinous baptism of the earliest converts
therein by Paulinus; &#x201c;above ten thousand men, besides women
and children, in one day,&#x201d; according to the chronicler, who,
perhaps to disarm incredulity, explains that the apostle having
baptized ten, sent them into the stream to baptize a hundred,
and so multiplied his assistants as the rite proceeded, while he
prayed on the shore.</p>

<p>By-and-by we meet signs of inhabitants&mdash;a house or two;
a few fields of mowing grass; the heaps of refuse at lead-mines,
and our walk derives a pleasurable interest from the
hourly change, the bleak, barren, and lonely, for the sheltered,
the cultivated, and inhabited. More and more are the hill-sides
wavy with grass as we descend, field after field shut in
by stone fences, and the dalesmen are beginning to mow. The
time of the hay harvest has come for the mountains: a month
later than in the south. How beautifully the bright green
contrasts with the dark purple distances, and softens the
features of the dale! And as I looked from side to side, or
around to the rear, as the fallen road made the hills seem
higher, and saw how much Swaledale has in common with a
valley of the Alps, I felt that here the desire for mountain
scenery might be satisfied; and I found myself watching for
the first field of grain with as much interest as I had watched
for vines in the Val Mont Joie.</p>

<p>I overtook a party of lead-miners, boys and men, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
home from work. The boys could read; but there was only
one of them who really liked reading. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good quiet
boy,&#x201d; said the father; &#x201c;likes to set down wi&#x2019; his book o&#x2019;
evenin&#x2019;s; t&#x2019;others says they is tired. He can draw a bit, too;
and I&#x2019;d like well to send&#x2019;n to a good skule; but I only gets
two pounds a month, and that&#x2019;s poor addlings.&#x201d; And one of
the young men wished that digging for lead didn&#x2019;t make
him so tired, for readin&#x2019; made him fall asleep, and yet he
wanted to get on with his books. &#x201c;It don&#x2019;t seem right,&#x201d; he
added, &#x201c;that a lad should want a bit o&#x2019; larnin&#x2019; and not get it.&#x201d;
I said a few words about the value of habit, the steady growth
of knowledge from only half an hour&#x2019;s application continued
day after day at the same hour, and the many ways of learning
offered to us apart from books. The whole party listened
with interest, and expressed their thanks when we parted at
the hamlet of Stonesdale. The lad thought he&#x2019;d try. He&#x2019;d
emigrate, only his wage was too low for saving.</p>

<p>If I had the missionary spirit, I would not go to Patagonia
or Feejee; but to the out-of-the-way places in my own
country, and labour trustfully there to remove some of the
evils of ignorance. Any man who should set himself to
such a work, thinking not more highly of himself than he ought
to think, would be welcomed in every cottage, and become
assured after a while, that many an eye would watch gladly
for his coming. One of my first tasks should be to go about
and pull up that old pedlar&#x2019;s mischievous tares, and plant instead
thereof a practical knowledge of common things.</p>

<p>With unlimited supplies of stone to draw on, the houses
of Stonesdale are as rough and solid as if built by Druids.
Every door has a porch for protection against storms, and
round each window a stripe of whitewash betrays the
rudimentary ornamental art of the inmates. A little farther,
and coming to the village of Thwaite, I called at the <i>Joiners&#x2019;
Arms</i> for a glass of ale. The landlord, mistaking my voice
for that of one of his friends, came hastily into the kitchen
with a jovial greeting, and apparently my being a stranger
made no difference, for he sat down and began a hearty talk
about business; about his boyhood, when he used to run
after the hounds; about his children, and the school down at
Muker. I laughed when he mentioned running after the
hounds, for, as I saw him, he was, as Southey has it, &#x201c;broad
in the rear and abdominous in the van.&#x201d; His agility had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
been a fact, nevertheless. I praised the beer. That did not
surprise him; he brewed it himself, out of malt and hops,
too; not out of doctor&#x2019;s stuff. I asked a question about
Hawes, to which I was going over the Pass. &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; said
he, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s terribly fallen off for drink. I used to keep the inn
there. A man could get a living in that day by selling drink;
but now the Methodists and teetotallers have got in among &#x2019;em,
and the place is quite ruined.&#x201d; Manifestly my heavy friend
looked at the question from the licensed victualler&#x2019;s point of
view. Concerning the school down at Muker, however he
was not uncharitable. &#x2019;Twas a good school&mdash;a church school.
There was a chapel of ease there to Grinton. Mr. Lowther did
the preaching and looked after the school, and the people liked
his teaching and liked his preaching. He brought the children
on well, gals as well as the boys; that he did.</p>

<p>If, reader, you should go to Thwaite, and wish to have a
chat with a jolly landlord, enquire for Matty John Ned, the
name by which he is known in all the country round;
remembering what happened in my experience. For when,
late in the evening, I intimated to mine host of the <i>White
Hart</i> at Hawes that Mr. Edward Alderson had recommended
me to his house, he replied, doubtfully, &#x201c;Alderson&mdash;Alderson
at Thwaite do you say?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Yes, Alderson at Thwaite: a big man.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;O-o-o-o-h! You mean Matty John Ned.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Below Thwaite the dale expands; trees appear; you see
Muker about three miles distant, the chief village of Upper
Swaledale: still nothing but grass in the fields; and the
same all the way to Reeth, ten miles from Muker. There
you would begin to see grain. Not far from Thwaite I turned
up a very steep, stony road on the right, which leads over the
Buttertubs Pass into Wensleydale, and soon could look down
on the village, and miles of Swaledale, and the hills beyond.
Among those hills are glens and ravines, and many a spot
that it would be a pleasure to explore, to say nothing of the
lead mines, and the &#x2018;gliffs&#x2019; of primitive manners; and any
one who could be content with homely head-quarters at
Muker or Thwaite might enjoy a roaming holiday for a week
or two. And for lovers of the angle there are trout in the
brooks.</p>

<p>The ascent is long as well as steep, and rough withal; but
the views repay you every time you pause with more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of the features of a mountain pass. There are about it touches
of savage grandeur, and the effect of these was heightened at
the time I crossed by a deep dark cloud-shadow which overspread
a league of the hills, and left the lower range of the
dale in full sunshine. For a while the road skirts the edge of
a deep glen on the left; it becomes deeper and deeper; there
are little fields, and haymakers at work at the bottom; then
the slopes change; the heather creeps down; the beck frets
and foams, sending its noise upward to your ear; screes and
scars intermingle their rugged forms and variations of colour;
a waterfall rushes down the crags; and when these have passed
before your eyes you find yourself on a desolate summit.</p>

<p>More desolate than any of the heights I had yet passed
over. A broad table-land of turf bogs, coffee-coloured pools,
stacks of turf, patches of rushes, and great boulders peeping
everywhere out from among the hardy heather. The dark
cloud still hung aloft, and the wind blew chill, making me
quicken my pace, and feel the more pleasure when, after
about half an hour, the view opened into Wensleydale. A
valley appears on the right, with colts and cattle grazing on
the bright green slopes; the road descends; stone abounds;
fences, large gate-posts, all are made of stone; the road gets
rougher; and by-and-by we come to Shaw, a little village
under Stag Fell, by the side of a wooded glen, from which
there rises the music of a mountain brook. On the left you
see Lord Wharncliffe&#x2019;s lodge, to which he resorts with his
friends on the 12th of August, for the hills around are inhabited
by grouse. Yonder the walls and windows of Hawes
reflect the setting sun, and we see more of Wensleydale, where
trees are numerous in the landscape.</p>

<p>Then another little village, Simonstone, where, passing
through the public-house by the bridge, we find a path that
leads us into a rocky chasm, about ninety feet deep and twice
as much in width, the limestone cliffs hung with trees and
bushes, here and there a bare crag jutting out, or lying
shattered beneath; while, cutting the grassy floor in two, a
lively beck ripples its way along. A bend conceals its source;
but we saunter on, and there at the end of the ravine, where
the cliffs advance and meet, we see the beck making one leap
from top to bottom&mdash;and that is Hardraw Scar. The rock
overhangs above, hence the water shoots clear of the cliff, and
preserves an irregular columnar form, widening at the base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
with bubbles and spray. You can go behind it, and look
through the falling current against the light, and note how it
becomes fuller and fuller of lines of beads as it descends, until
they all commingle in the flurry below. Dr. Tyndall might
make an observatory of this cool nook, the next time he investigates
the cause of the noise in falling water, with the
advantage of looking forth on the romantic and pleasing scene
beyond. The geologist finds in the ravine a suggestive illustration
on a small scale of what Niagara with thunderous
plunge has been accomplishing through countless ages&mdash;namely,
wearing away the solid rock, inch by inch, foot by
foot, until in the one instance a river chasm is formed miles in
length, and here, in the other, a pretty glen a little more than
a furlong deep.</p>

<p>At the time I saw it, the quantity of water was probably
not more than would fill a twelve-inch tube; but after heavy
rains the upper stream forms a broad horseshoe fall as it
rushes over the curving cliff. In the severe frost of 1740,
when the Londoners were holding a fair on the Thames, Hardraw
Scar was frozen, and, fed continually from the source
above, it became at last a cone of ice, ninety feet in height,
and as much in circumference at the base: a phenomenon that
was long remembered by the gossips of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Hawes cheats the eye, and seems near, when by the road
it is far off. On the way thither from Simonstone we cross
the Ure, the river of Wensleydale, a broad and shallow, yet
lively stream, infusing a charm into the landscape, which I
saw at the right moment, when the evening shadows were
creeping from the meadows up the hill-sides, and the water
flashed with gold and crimson ripples. I lingered on the
bridge till the last gleam vanished.</p>

<p>So grim and savage are the fells at the head of Wensleydale,
that the country folk in times past regarded them with
superstitious dread, and called the little brooks which there
foster the infancy of Ure, &#x2018;hell-becks&#x2019;&mdash;a name of dread.
But both river and dale change their character as they descend,
the one flowing through scenes of exquisite beauty ere,
united with the Swale, it forms the Ouse; and the dale
broadens into the richest and most beautiful of all the North
Riding.</p>

<p>Four miles from Hawes down the dale is the pleasant
village of Bainbridge, where the rustic houses, with flower-plots
in front and roses climbing on the walls, and yellow
stonecrop patching the roofs and fences, look out upon a few
noble sycamores, and a green&mdash;a real village green. The
hills on each side are lofty and picturesque; at one end, on
a flat eminence, remains the site of a Roman camp; the
Bain, a small stream coming from a lake some three miles
distant, runs through the place in a bed of solid stone, to enter
Ure a little below, and all around encroaching here and there
up the hill-sides spread meadows of luxuriant grass. The
simple rural beauty will gladden your eye, and&mdash;as with every
stranger who comes to Bainbridge&mdash;win your admiration.</p>

<p>Wensleydale enjoys a reputation for cheese and fat pastures
and wealth above the neighbouring dales, and appears to be
fully aware of its superiority. The folk, moreover, consider
themselves refined, advanced in civilization in comparison
with the dwellers on the other side of Buttertubs: those
whom we talked with yesterday. &#x201c;Mr. White, if you had
wanted a wife, do you think you could choose one out of
Swaledale?&#x201d; was the question put to me by a strapping village
lass before I had been three hours in Bainbridge.</p>

<p>Fortune favoured me. I found here some worthy Quaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
friends of mine, who had journeyed from Oxfordshire to spend
the holidays under the paternal rooftree. It was almost as if
I had arrived at home myself; and although I had breakfasted
at Hawes, they took it for granted that I would eat a lunch to
keep up my strength till dinner-time. They settled a plan
which would keep me till the morrow exploring the neighbourhood&mdash;a
detention by no means to be repined at&mdash;and
introduced me to a studious young dalesman, the village
author, who knew every nook of the hills, every torrent and
noteworthy site, and all the legends therewith associated for
miles round, and who was to be my guide and companion.</p>

<p>Away we rambled across the Ure to a small wooded hollow
at the foot of Whitfell, in the hills which shut out Swaledale.
It conceals a Hardraw Scar in miniature, shooting from an
overhanging ledge of dark shale, in which are numerous fossil
shells. From this we followed the hill upwards to Millgill
Force, a higher fall, on another beck, overshadowed by firs
and the mountain elm, and which Nature keeps as a shrine
approachable only by the active foot and willing heart. Now
you must struggle through the tall grass and tangle on the
precipitous sides high among the trees; now stride and
scramble over the rocky masses in the bed of the stream. To
sit and watch the fall deep under the canopy of leaves, catching
glimpses of sunshine and of blue sky above, and to enjoy the
delicious coolness, was the luxury of enjoyment. I could
have sat for hours. Wordsworth came here during one of his
excursions in Yorkshire; and if you wish to know what Millgill
Force is, as painted by the pen, even the minute touches,
read his description.</p>

<p>But there is yet another&mdash;Whitfell Force&mdash;higher up,
rarely visited, for the hill is steep and the way toilsome. My
guide, however, was not less willing to lead than I to follow,
and soon we were scrambling through the deepest ravine of
all, where the sides, for the most part, afford no footing, not
even for a goat, but rise in perpendicular walls, or lean over
at the top. Here again the lavish foliage is backed by the
dark stiff spines of firs, and every inch of ground, every
cranny, all but the impenetrable face of the rock, is hidden
by rank grasses, trailing weeds, climbers, periwinkle, woodbine,
and ferns, among which the hart&#x2019;s-tongue throws out
its large drooping clusters of graceful fronds. For greater
part of the way we had to keep the bed of the stream; now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
squeezing ourselves between mighty lumps of limestone that
nearly barred the passage, so that the stream itself could not
get through without a struggle; now climbing painfully over
where the crevices were too narrow; now zigzagging from
side to side wherever the big stones afforded foothold, not
without slips and splashes that multiplied our excitement;
now pausing on a broad slab to admire the narrowing chasm
and all its exquisite greenery. My companion pointed out a
crystal pool in which he sometimes bathed&mdash;a bath that Naiads
themselves might envy. In this way we came at length to a
semicircular opening, and saw the fall tumbling from crag to
crag for sixty feet, and dispersing itself into a confused shower
before it fell into the channel beneath. We both sat for a
while without speaking, listening to the cool splash and busy
gurgle as the water began its race down the hill; and, for my
part, I felt that fatigue and labour were well repaid by the
sight of so lovely a dell.</p>

<p>Then by other paths we returned to the village, and
mounted to the flat-topped grassy mound, which Professor
Phillips says, is an ancient gravel heap deposited by the action
of water. The Romans, taking advantage of the site, levelled
it, and established thereon a small camp. A statue and
inscription and some other relics have been found, showing
that in this remote spot, miles distant from their main highway,
the conquerors had a military station, finding it no doubt
troublesome to keep the dalesmen of their day in order.</p>

<p>Then we looked at a very, very old millstone, which now
stands on its edge at the corner of a cottage doing motionless
duty as one end of a kennel. The dog creeps in through the
hole in the middle. There it stands, an unsatisfactory antique,
for no one knows anything about it. Of two others, however,
which we next saw, something is known&mdash;the old horn and
the old hornblower. Bainbridge was chief place of the forest
of Wensleydale&mdash;of which the Duke of Leeds is now Her
Majesty&#x2019;s Ranger, and at the same time hereditary Constable
and Lord of Middleham Castle&mdash;and from time immemorial
the &#x201c;forest horn&#x201d; has been blown on the green, every night
at ten o&#x2019;clock, from the end of September to Shrovetide, and
it is blown still; for are not ancient customs all but immortal
in our country? The stiff-jointed graybeard hearing that a
curious stranger wished to look at the instrument, brought it
forth. It is literally a horn&mdash;a large ox-horn, lengthened by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a hoop of now rusty tin, to make up for the pieces which
some time or other had been broken from its mouth. He
himself had put on the tin years ago. Of course I was
invited to blow a blast, and of course failed. My companion,
however, could make it speak lustily; but the old man did
best, and blew a long-sustained note, which proved him to be
as good an economist of breath as a pearl-diver. For years
had he thus blown, and his father before him. I could not
help thinking of the olden time ere roads were made, and of
belated travellers saved from perishing in the snow by that
nightly signal.</p>

<p>Now it was tea-time, and we had tea served after the
Wensleydale manner&mdash;plain cakes and currant cakes, cakes
hot and cold, and butter and cheese at discretion, with liberty
to call for anything else that you like; and the more you eat
and drink, the more will you rise in the esteem of your hospitable
entertainers. And after that I went down to the hay-field,
for it was a large field, and the farmer longed to get the
hay all housed before sunset. They don&#x2019;t carry hay in the
dales, they &#x2018;lead&#x2019; it; and the two boys from Oxfordshire
were not a little proud in having the &#x2018;leading&#x2019; assigned
to them, seeing that they had nothing to do but ride the horse
that drew the hay-sledge to and fro between the barn and the
&#x2018;wind-rows.&#x2019; Another difference is, that forks are not used
except to pitch the hay from the sledge to the barn, all the
rest&mdash;turning the swath, making into cocks&mdash;is done with the
rake and by hand. So I took a rake, and beginning at one
side of the field at the same time with an old hand, worked
away so stoutly, that he had much ado to keep ahead of me.
And so it went on, all hands working as if there were no such
thing as weariness, load after load slipping away to the barn;
and I unconsciously growing meritorious. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the first
cockney I ever saw,&#x201d; said the stalwart farmer, &#x201c;that knew
how to handle a rake.&#x201d; Had I stayed with him a week, he
would have discovered other of my capabilities equally praiseworthy.
We should have accomplished the task and cleared
the field; but a black cloud rose in the west, and soon sent
down a heavy shower, and compelled us to huddle up the
remaining rows into cocks, and leave them till morning.</p>

<p>Must I confess it? Haymaking with the blithesome lasses
in Ulrichsthal is a much more sprightly pastime than haymaking
with the Quakers in Wensleydale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The hay harvest is an exciting time in the dales, for grass
is the only crop, and the cattle have to be fed all through the
long months of winter, and sometimes far into the backward
spring. Hence every thing depends on the hay being carried
and housed in good condition; and many an anxious look is
cast at passing clouds and distant hill-tops to learn the signs
of the weather. The dalesmen are expert in the use of the
scythe; and numbers of them, after their own haymaking is
over, migrate into Holderness and other grain-growing districts,
and mow down the crops, even the wheat-fields, with remarkable
celerity.</p>

<p>Many a hand had I to shake the next morning, when the
moment came to say farewell. The student would not let me
depart alone; he would go with me a few miles, and show me
remarkable things by the way; and what was more, he would
carry my knapsack. &#x201c;You will have quite enough of it,&#x201d; he
said, &#x201c;before your travel is over.&#x201d; So I had to let him. We
soon diverged from the road and began the ascent of Addleborough
(<i>Edel-burg</i>,) that noble hill which rises on the south-east
of Bainbridge, rearing its rocky crest to a height of more
than fifteen hundred feet. We took the shortest way, climbing
the tall fences, struggling through heather, striding across
bogs, and disturbing the birds. The curlews began their
circling flights above our heads, and the grouse took wing with
sudden flutter, eight or ten brace starting from a little patch
that, to my inexperience, seemed too small to hide a couple
of chickens.</p>

<p>My companion talked as only a dalesman can talk&mdash;as one
whose whole heart is in his subject. None but a dalesman,
he said, could read Wordsworth aright, or really love him.
He could talk of the history of the dale, and of the ways of
the people. His great-grandmother was the first in Bainbridge
who ever had a teapot. When tea first began to be heard of
in those parts, a bagman called on an old farmer, and fascinated
him so by praising the virtues of the new leaf from China,
that with his wife&#x2019;s approval he ordered a &#x2018;stean&#x2019; to begin
with. The trader ventured to suggest that a stone of tea
would be a costly experiment, and sent them only a pound.
Some months afterwards he called again for &#x201c;money and
orders,&#x201d; and asked how the worthy couple liked the tea.
&#x201c;Them was the nastiest greens we ever tasted,&#x201d; was the
answer. &#x201c;The parcel cam&#x2019; one morning afore dinner, so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
missus tied &#x2019;em up in a cloth and put &#x2019;em into t&#x2019; pot along wi&#x2019;
t&#x2019; bacon. But we couldn&#x2019;t abear &#x2019;em when they was done;
and as for t&#x2019; broth, we couldn&#x2019;t sup a drop on &#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Having climbed the last steep slope, we sat down in a
recess of the rocky frontlet which the hill bears proudly on its
brow, and there, sheltered from the furious wind, surveyed
the scene below. We could see across the opposite fells, in
places, to the summits on the farther side of Swaledale, and
down Wensleydale for miles, and away to the blue range of
the Hambleton hills that look into the Vale of York. Bainbridge
appears as quiet as if it were taking holiday; yonder,
Askrigg twinkles under a thin white veil of smoke; and farther,
Bolton Castle&mdash;once the prison of the unhappy Queen
of Scots&mdash;shows its four square towers above a rising wood:
all basking in the glorious sunshine. Yet shadows are not
wanting. Many a dark shade marks where a glen breaks the
hill-sides: some resemble crooked furrows, trimmed here and
there with a dull green fringe, the tree-tops peeping out, and
by these signs the beck we explored yesterday may be discerned
on the opposite fell. Wherever that little patch of
wood appears, there we may be sure a waterfall, though all
unseen, is joining in the great universal chorus. Ure winds
down the dale in many a shining curve, of which but one is
visible between bright green meadow slopes, and belts, and
clumps of wood, that broaden with the distance; and all the
landscape is studded with the little white squares&mdash;the homes
of the dalesmen.</p>

<p>Four miles below the stream rushes over great steps of
limestone which traverse its bed at Aysgarth Force, and flows
onwards past Penhill, the mountain of Wensleydale, overtopping
Addleborough by three hundred feet; past Witton
Fell and its spring, still known as Diana&#x2019;s Bath; past Leyburn,
and its high natural terrace&mdash;the Shawl, where the &#x2018;Queen&#x2019;s
gap&#x2019; reminds the visitor once more of Mary riding through
surrounded by a watchful escort; past Middleham, where the
lordly castle of the King-maker now stands in hopeless ruin,
recalling the names of Anne of Warwick, Isabella of
Clarence, Edward IV., and his escape from the haughty baron&#x2019;s
snare; of Richard of Gloucester, and others who figure in
our national history; past Coverdale, the birthplace of that
Miles Coverdale whose translation of the Bible will keep his
memory green through many a generation, and the site of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Coverham Abbey, of which but a few arches now remain.
It was built in 1214 for the Premonstratensians, or White
Canons, who never wore linen. Where the Cover falls into
the Ure, spreads the meadow Ulshaw, the place from which
Oswin dismissed his army in 651. Tradition preserves the
memory of Hugh de Moreville&#x2019;s seat, though not of the exact
site, and thus associates the neighbourhood with one of the
slayers of Becket. And at East Witton, beyond Coverham,
are the ruins of the Cistercian Abbey of Jervaux&mdash;Jarvis
Abbey, as the country folk call it&mdash;a relic dating from 1156.
Plunderers and the weather had their own way with it until
1805, when the Earl of Aylesbury, to whom the estate
belongs, inspired by his steward&#x2019;s discovery of a tesselated
pavement, stayed the progress of dilapidation, and had the
concealing heaps of grass-grown rubbish dug away. Old
Jenkins, who died in 1670, remembered Jervaux as it stood
in its prime: he had shared the dole given by the monks to
poor wayfarers. He remembered, too, the mustering of the
dalesmen under the banner of the good Lord Scroop of Bolton
for the battle of Flodden, when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;With him did wend all Wensleydale<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From Morton unto Morsdale moor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All they that dwell by the banks of Swale<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With him were bent in harness stour.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At Spennithorne, a village over against Coverham, were
born John Hutchinson, the opponent of Newton, and Hatfield
the crazy, who fired at George III. The philosopher&mdash;who
was a yeoman&#x2019;s son&mdash;made some stir in his day by publishing
<i>Moses&#x2019;s Principia</i>, in opposition to Sir Isaac&#x2019;s, and by his
collection of fossils, out of which he contrived arguments
against geologists. This collection was bequeathed to Dr.
Woodward, and eventually became part of the museum in the
University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Looking across the dale, somewhat to the right of Bainbridge,
we see Nappa Hall, long the seat of the Metcalfes.
In Queen Mary&#x2019;s time, Sir Christopher Metcalfe was sheriff,
and he met the judges at York at the head of three hundred
horsemen, all dressed alike, and all of his own name and
family. The name is still a common one in the North Riding,
as you will soon discover on the front of public-houses, over
the door at toll-bars, and on the sides of carts and wagons.
The present Lord Metcalfe had a Guisborough man for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
father. A Metcalfe, born at Coverhead, is said to have made
Napoleon&#x2019;s coffin at St. Helena. One of the fighting men
who distinguished themselves at Agincourt was a Metcalfe.
The Queen of Scots&#x2019; bedstead is still preserved at Nappa.
Raleigh once visited the Hall, and brought with him&mdash;so the
story goes&mdash;the first crayfish ever seen in the dale. Another
visitor was that cruel pedant, Royal Jamie, who scrupled not
to cut off Raleigh&#x2019;s head&mdash;a far better one than his own&mdash;and
concerning him we are told that he rode across the Ure on the
back of one of the serving-men. Perhaps the poor serving-man
felt proud all his life after.</p>

<p>If to dream about the Past by the side of a spring be one
of your pleasures, you may enjoy it here in Wensleydale with
many a change of scene. Besides Diana&#x2019;s Bath, already mentioned,
St. Simon&#x2019;s Spring still bubbles up at Coverham, St.
Alkelda&#x2019;s at Middleham, and the Fairies&#x2019; Well at Hornby.
To this last an old iron cup was chained, which a late local
antiquary fondly thought might be one of those which King
Edwin ordered to be fastened to running springs throughout
his territories.</p>

<p>Celt and Northman have left their traces. The grandmothers
of the children who now play in the village could
remember the Beltane bonfires, and the wild dances around
them. The Danes peopled the gloomy savage parts of the
glen with their imaginary black alfs. An old couplet runs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Druid, Roman, Scandinavia<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stone Raise, on Addleboro&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So we sat and talked, and afterwards scrambled up the
rocks to the summit. Here is, or rather was, a Druid circle of
flat stones: but my companion screamed with vexation on
discovering that three or four of the largest stones had been
taken away, and were nowhere to be seen. The removal
must have been recent, for the places where they lay were
sharply defined in the grass, and the maze of roots which had
been covered for ages was still dense and blanched. And so an
ancient monument must be destroyed either out of wanton
mischief, or to be broken up for the repair of a fence! Whoever
were the perpetrators, I say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Oh, be their tombs as lead to lead!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We walked across the top to Stain-Ray, or Stone Raise, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
great cromlech or cairn 360 feet in circumference. You would
perhaps regard it as nothing more than a huge irregular mound
of lumps of gritstone bleached by the weather, with ferns
and moss growing in the interstices, but within there are to
be seen the remains of three cysts, of which only one retains
a definite form. It is said that a skeleton was discovered
therein. Tradition tells of a giant who once travelling with
a chest of gold on his back from Skipton Castle to Pendragon,
felt weary while crossing Addleborough, and let his burden
slip, but recovering himself, he cried,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Spite of either God or man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Pendragon castle thou shalt gang.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>when it fell from his shoulders, sank into the earth, and the
stones rose over it. There the chest remained, and still remains,
only to be recovered by the fortunate mortal to whom
the fairy may appear in the form of a hen or an ape. He has
then but to stretch forth his arm, seize the chest, and drag it
out, in silence if he can, at all events without swearing, or he
will fail, as did that unfortunate wight, who, uttering an oath
in the moment of success, lost his hold of the treasure, and
saw the fairy no more as long as he lived.</p>

<p>We descended into the hollow between Addleborough and
Stake Fell, crossing on the way the natural terrace that runs
along the southern and western sides of the hill, to look at a
cluster of heaps of stone, and low, irregular walls or fences,
the plan of which appears to show a series of enclosures
opening one into the other. My friend had long made up his
mind that these were the remains of an ancient British village.
For my part, I could not believe that a village old as the
Roman conquest would leave vestiges of such magnitude after
the lapse of nearly two thousand years; whereupon, arguments,
and learned ones, were adduced, until I half admitted
the origin assigned. But a few days later I saw an enclosure
in Wharfedale identical in form with any one of these, used
as a sheepfold, and all my doubts came back with renewed
force. In the ordnance maps, the description is &#x201c;ancient
enclosures;&#x201d; and, to give an off-hand opinion, it appears to
me probable that this outlying hollow may have been chosen
as a safe place for the flocks in the troublous days of old.</p>

<p>Stake Fell is 1843 feet in height, rising proudly on our left.
Beneath us, in the valley Ray or Roedale, a branch of Wens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>leydale,
spreads Simmer Water, a lake of one hundred and
five acres. Shut in by hills, and sprinkled with wood around
its margin, it beautifies and enlivens the landscape. It
abounds in trout, moreover, and bream and grayling, and any
one who chooses may fish therein, as well as in the Ure, all
the way down to Bainbridge, and farther. The river trout are
considered far superior to those of the lake. We made haste
down, after a pause to observe the view, for dinner awaited
us in a pleasant villa overlooking the bright rippling expanse.</p>

<p>When we started anew, some two hours later, our hospitable
entertainer would accompany us. We walked round
the foot of the lake, and saw on the margin, near the break
where the Bain flows out, two big stones which have lain in
their present position ever since the devil and a giant pelted
one another from hill to hill across the water. To corroborate
the legend, there yet remain on the stones the marks&mdash;and
prodigious ones they are&mdash;of the Evil One&#x2019;s hands. To
me the marks appeared more like the claws of an enormous
bird, compared with which Dr. Mantell&#x2019;s <i>Dinornis</i> would be
but a chicken.</p>

<p>Long, long ago, while the Apostles still walked the earth, a
poor old man wandered into Raydale, where a large city then
stood, and besought alms from house to house. Every door
was shut against him, save one, an humble cot without the
city wall, where the inmates bade him welcome, and set oaten
bread and milk cheese before him, and prepared him a pallet
whereon to sleep. On the morrow the old man pronounced a
blessing on the house and departed; but as he went forth, he
turned, and looking on the city, thus spake:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Semer Water rise, Semer Water sink,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And swallow all the town<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Save this little house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where they gave me meat and drink.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whereupon followed the roar of an earthquake, and the rush
of water; the city sank down and a broad lake rolled over its
site; but the charitable couple who lodged the stranger were
preserved, and soon by some miraculous means they found
themselves rich, and a blessing rested on them and their
posterity.</p>

<p>Besides the satanic missiles, there are stones somewhere on
the brink of the lake known as the &#x2018;Mermaid Stones,&#x2019; but
not one of us knew where to look for them, so we set our faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
towards Counterside, the hill on the northern side of the vale
and trudged patiently up the steep ascent in the hot afternoon
sun, repaid by the widening prospect. We could see where
waterfalls were rushing in the little glens at the head of the
dale, and the shadow of hills in the lake, and the remotest
village, Stalling Busk, said to be a place of unusual thrift.
Even in that remote nook, you would find the dalesmen&#x2019;s
maxim kept from rusting, as well in the villages lower down
and nearer the world: it is&mdash;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to chate, or to be
chated; but if it must be one or t&#x2019;other, why, then, I
wouldn&#x2019;t be chated.&#x201d; It is no scandal to say that money-grubbing
in the dale is proverbial. &#x201c;Look at that man,&#x201d;
said my Quaker friend at Bainbridge, pointing out what
looked like a labourer driving a cart; &#x201c;that man is worth
thousands.&#x201d; I did not hear, however, that he made an offensive
use of his talent, as certain money-grubbers do in the
neighbourhood of large towns. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got nought,&#x201d; exclaimed
a coarse, rich man near Hull, slapping his pocket, of a poor
man who differed from him in opinion: &#x201c;he&#x2019;s got nought&mdash;what
should he know about it?&#x201d;</p>

<p>We went down on the other slope of Counterside with
Hawes in sight, and Cam Fell, a long ridgy summit more
than 1900 feet high. I preferred to double it rather than go
over it, and having shifted the knapsack to my own shoulders,
shook hands with my excellent friends, and choosing short
cuts so as to avoid the town, came in about an hour to the
steep lonely road which turns up into Widdale, beyond the
farther end of Hawes.</p>

<p>We shall return to Wensleydale a few days hence; meanwhile,
good-natured reader, Widdale stretches before us, the
road rising with little interruption for miles. Two hours of
brisk walking will carry us through it between great wild hill
slopes, which are channeled here and there by the dry, stony
bed of a torrent. The evening closes in heavy and lowering,
and Cam Fell and Widdale Fell uprear their huge forms on
the right and left in sullen gloom, and appear the more mountainous.
Ere long thick mists overspread their summits, and
send ragged wreaths down the hollows, and much of the landscape
becomes dim, and we close our day with a view of
Nature in one of her mysterious moods. We ascend into the
bleak region, pass the bare little hamlet of Redshaw, catch a
dull glimpse of Ingleborough, with its broad flat summit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
then at six miles from Hawes, come to the lonesome public-house
at Newby Head.</p>

<p>Of such wild land as that we have traversed. Arthur Young
once bought a large tract, having in view a grand scheme of
reclamation, but was diverted therefrom by his appointment
as Secretary to the Board of Agriculture. &#x201c;What a change,&#x201d;
he says, &#x201c;in the destination of a man&#x2019;s life! Instead of
entering the solitary lord of four thousand acres, in the keen
atmosphere of lofty rocks and mountain torrents, with a little
creation rising gradually around me, making the desert smile
with cultivation, and grouse give way to industrious population,
active and energetic, though remote and tranquil; and
every instant of my existence, making two blades of grass to
grow where not one was found before&mdash;behold me at a desk,
in the smoke, the fog, the din of Whitehall!&#x201d;</p>

<p>The public-house is a resort for cattle-dealers from Scotland,
and head-quarters for shepherds and labourers. The fare is
better than the lodging. Three kinds of cakes, eggs, and
small pies of preserved bilberries, were set before me at tea;
but the bed, though the sheets were clean, had a musty smell
of damp straw.</p>

<p>On the way hither, I had noticed what was to me a novel
mode of bill-sticking; that is, on the sharp spines of tall
thistles by the wayside. The bills advertised <i>Gimmer Hogs</i>
for sale, a species of animal that I had never before heard of,
and I puzzled myself not a little in guessing what they could
be. For although <i>Gimmer</i> is good honest Danish, signifying
a ewe that has not yet lambed, the connexion between sheep
and swine is not obvious to the uninitiated. However, it
happened that I sat down to breakfast with a Scottish grazier
who had arrived soon after daybreak, and he told me that
sheep not more than one year old are called Gimmer Hogs;
but why the word hogs should be used to describe ewes he
could not tell.</p>

<p>The morning was dull and drizzly, and by the time I had
crossed to Ingleton Fell, from the North to the West Riding,
a swift, horizontal rain came on, laborious to walk against,
and drove me for shelter into the <i>Gearstones Inn</i>. Of the two
or three houses hereabouts, one is a school; and in this wild
spot a Wednesday market is held. Ingleborough is in sight;
the hills around form pleasing groups, and had we time to
explore them, we should find many a rocky glen, and curious
cave, Catknot Hole, Alum Pot, Long Churn, and Dicken Pot;
and many a sounding ghyll, as the folk here call it&mdash;that is, a
waterfall. Not far from the inn is Gale beck, the source of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Ribble; and as we proceed down the now continuous descent,
so do the features of the landscape grow more romantic.</p>

<p>For more than an hour did the rain-storm sweep across the
hills, holding me prisoner. At length faint gleams of sunshine
broke through; I started afresh, and three miles farther
was treading on classic ground&mdash;Chapel-le-Dale. Turn in at
the second gate on the right beyond the public-house, and you
will soon have speech with Mr. Metcalfe, who keeps the key
of Weathercote cave. Standing on a sheltered valley slope,
with a flower-garden in front and trees around, his house
presents a favourable specimen of a yeoman&#x2019;s residence. No
lack of comfort here, I thought, on seeing the plenteous store
of oaten bread on the racks in the kitchen. Nor is there any
lack of attention to the visitor&#x2019;s wishes on the part of Mr.
Metcalfe. He unlocks a door, and leads the way down a
steep, rude flight of steps into a rocky chasm, from which
ascends the noise of falling water. A singularly striking
scene awaits you. The rocks are thickly covered in places
with ferns and mosses, and are broken up by crevices into a
diversity of forms, rugged as chaos. A few feet down, and
you see a beautiful crystalline spring in a cleft on the right,
and the water turning the moss to stone as it trickles down.
A few feet lower and you pass under a natural bridge formed
by huge fallen blocks. The stair gets rougher, twisting among
the big, damp lumps of limestone, when suddenly your guide
points to the fall at the farther extremity of the chasm. The
rocks are black, the place is gloomy, imparting thereby a
surprising effect to the white rushing column of water. A
beck running down the hill finds its way into a crevice in the
cliffs, from which it leaps in one great fall of more than
eighty feet, roaring loudly. Look up! the chasm is so narrow
that the trees and bushes overhang and meet overhead; and
what with the subdued light, and mixture of crags and
verdure, and the impressive aspect of the place altogether,
you will be lost in admiration.</p>

<p>To descend lower seems scarcely possible, but you do get
down, scrambling over the big stones to the very bottom, into
the swirling shower of spray. Here a deep recess, or chamber
at one side, about eight feet in height, affords good standing
ground, whence you may see that the water is swallowed up
at once, and disappears in the heap of pebbles on which it
falls. Conversation is difficult, for the roar is overpowering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
After I had stood some minutes in contemplation, Mr. Metcalfe
told me that it was possible to get behind the fall and
look through it, taking care to run quickly across the strong
blast that meets you on starting from the recess. I buttoned
my overcoat to my chin, and rushed into the cavity,
and looked upwards. I was in a pit 120 feet deep, covered
by a tumultuous curtain of water, but had to make a speedy
retreat, so furiously was I enveloped by blinding spray. To
make observations from that spot one should wear a suit of
waterproof.</p>

<p>Through the absence of sunshine I lost the sight of the
rainbow which is seen for about two hours in the middle of
the day from the front of the fall. It is a horizontal bow
with the convex side towards the water, shifting its position
higher or lower as you mount or descend.</p>

<p>Although it might now be properly described as a pit, the
chasm gives you the impression of a cave of which the roof
has fallen in. If this be so, the fall was once entirely underground,
roaring day and night in grim darkness. It may still
be regarded as an underground fall, for the throat from which
it leaps is more than thirty feet below the surface. In the
cleft above this throat a thick heavy slab is fixed in a singular
position, just caught, as it seems, by two of its corners, so that
you fancy it ready to tumble at any moment with the current
that shoots so swiftly beneath it. As you pause often on returning
to look back at the roaring stream, and up to the
impending crags, you will heartily confirm Professor Sedgwick&mdash;who
by the way is a Yorkshireman&mdash;in his opinion, that
if Weathercote Cave be small, it is a very gem. Nor will
you grudge the shilling fee for admission.</p>

<p>The extreme length of the pit is about 180 feet. In rainy
weather it becomes a sink-hole into which the streams pour
from all the slopes around, at times filling it to the brim and
running over. Mr. Metcalfe shewed me the stem of a tree
entangled in the crevices near the top, which had been floated
there by the floods of the previous winter. While coming
slowly up, I could not fail to notice the change of temperature,
from the chill damp that made me shiver, to a pleasant
warmth, and then to the heavy heat of a dull day in July.</p>

<p>A little way below the house, going down the narrow dale,
you come to another mossy crevice in the rocks among the
trees to which the country folk have given the name of Gingle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
or Jingle Pot, because of a certain jingling sound produced by
stones when thrown therein. To my ear there was no ring in
the sound. It is quite dry, with a bottom sloping steeply
and making a sudden turn to a depth of eighty feet. Mr.
Metcalfe had let himself down into the Pot by a rope, two
days before my arrival, to look for a young cow that had
fallen in while on the gad, and disappeared in the lowest hole.
He saw the animal dead, and so tightly wedged in under the
rock, that there he left it. This was his second descent.
The first was made in winter some years ago to rescue his
ducks, which, perhaps deceived by the dark crevice, that
looked like a deep narrow pond when all the ground was
white with snow, took all together a sudden flight to settle on
it, and of course went to the bottom. Mr. Metcalfe was driving
them home at the time; he looked over the edge of the Pot,
and invited the silly birds to fly out. But no, they would not
be persuaded to use their wings, and remained crowded
together on the highest part of the slope, stretching their
necks upwards. So there was nothing for it but to fetch them
out. Their owner let himself down; yet after all his trouble
the ungrateful creatures refused as long as possible to be put
into the bag.</p>

<p>Farther down again, and you come to Hurtle Pot, a gloomy
cavity overhung by trees, and mantled with ivy, ferns, and
coarse weeds. At the bottom rests a darksome pool, said to be
twenty-seven feet deep, which contains small trout, and
swallows up rocks and stones, or whatever may be thrown
into it, without any perceptible diminution of the depth.
You can get down to the edge of the water by an inconvenient
path, and feel the gloom, and find excuses for the rustics
who believe in the existence of the Hurtle Pot Boggart. In
olden time his deeds were terrible; but of late years he only
frightens people with noises. Both this and Jingle Pot are
choked with water from subterranean channels in flood time,
and then there is heard here such an intermittent throbbing,
gurgling noise, accompanied by what seem dismal gaspings,
that a timorous listener might easily believe the Boggart was
drowning his victims. One evening a loving couple, walking
behind the trees above the Pot, heard most unearthly noises
arise from the murky chasm; never had the like been heard
before. Surely, thought the turtle-doves, the Boggart is
coming forth with some new trick, and they fled in terror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
A friend of Mr. Metcalfe&#x2019;s was playing his flute down on the
edge of the pool.</p>

<p>Again farther, and there is the little chapel from which
the dale takes its name. As I have said, we are here on classic
ground. That is the edifice, and this is the place described
by Southey. Here dwelt that worthy yeoman, Daniel Dove&#x2019;s
father, and his fathers before him, handing down their six-and-twenty
acres, and better yet, an honest name, from one
to the other through many generations&mdash;yea, from time
immemorial. One of those good old families which had
ancestors before the Conquest. Give me leave, good-natured
reader, to complete my sketch by the description as it appears,
with masterly touches, in <i>The Doctor</i>.</p>

<p>&#x201c;The little church called Chapel-le-Dale, stands about a
bowshot from the family house. There they had all been
carried to the font; there they had each led his bride to the
altar; and thither they had, each in his turn, been borne
upon the shoulders of their friends and neighbours. Earth
to earth they had been consigned there for so many generations,
that half of the soil of the churchyard consisted of their
remains. A hermit who might wish his grave to be as quiet
as his cell, could imagine no fitter resting-place. On three
sides there was an irregular low stone wall, rather to mark the
limits of the sacred ground, than to enclose it; on the fourth
it was bounded by the brook, whose waters proceed by a
subterraneous channel from Weathercote Cave. Two or three
alders and rowan-trees hung over the brook, and shed their
leaves and seeds into the stream. Some bushy hazels grew at
intervals along the lines of the wall; and a few ash-trees as
the winds had sown them. To the east and west some fields
adjoined it, in that state of half cultivation which gives a
human character to solitude: to the south, on the other side
the brook, the common with its limestone rocks peering everywhere
above ground, extended to the foot of Ingleborough.
A craggy hill, feathered with birch, sheltered it from the
north.</p>

<p>&#x201c;The turf was as soft and fine as that of the adjoining
hills; it was seldom broken, so scanty was the population to
which it was appropriated; scarcely a thistle or a nettle
deformed it, and the few tombstones which had been placed
there, were now themselves half buried. The sheep came
over the wall when they listed, and sometimes took shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
in the porch from the storm. Their voices and the cry of
the kite wheeling above, were the only sounds which were
heard there, except when the single bell which hung in its
niche over the entrance tinkled for service on the Sabbath
day, or with a slower tongue gave notice that one of the
children of the soil was returning to the earth from which he
sprung.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Is not that charming?&mdash;a word-picture, worthy of a master&#x2019;s
pen. One error, however, has slipped in. There is no porch,
nor any sign that one has ever been. The chapel will hold
eighty persons, and is, as Mr. Metcalfe, informed me, &#x201c;never
too small.&#x201d;</p>

<p>A week or more might be spent in explorations in this
neighbourhood. Five miles down towards Kirkby Lonsdale,
there is Thornton Force. Near it is Yordas Cave&mdash;once the
haunt of a giant; Gatekirk Cave is distant about half an hour&#x2019;s
walk; Douk Hole is in the neighbourhood of Ingleton; and
in all the region, and over the Westmoreland border, there is
a highly picturesque succession of caves, ravines, glens, and
torrents dashing through rocky chasms, and of all the magnificent
phenomena only to be seen amid the limestone.
Many a tourist hurries past on his way to the Lakes all
unmindful of scenery which, in its kind, surpasses any that
he will see between Windermere and Bassenthwaite.</p>

<p>I went up to the public-house and dined with the haymakers,
and enjoyed the sight of sunburnt rustics eating
smoking mutton-pie without stint, as much as I did my own
repast. The host&#x2019;s daughter brought me a book, which had
only recently been provided to receive the names of visitors.
Among them was the autograph of a Russian gentleman who
had called within the week, and who, as I heard, did nothing
but grumble at English customs, yet could not help praising
the scenery. He was on foot, and with knapsack on shoulder.
I crossed his track, and heard of him sundry times afterwards,
and hoped to meet him, that I might ask leave to enlighten
him on a few points concerning which he appeared to be
distressingly ignorant.</p>

<p>I had planned to ascend and cross Ingleborough, and drop
down upon Clapham from its southern side; but when a hill
is half buried in mist, and furious scuds fly across its brow,
it is best to be content with the valley. So I took up my
route on the main road, and continued down the dale, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the limestone crags breaking out on each side form a series
of irregular terraces, intermingled green and gray, pleasing
to the eye. In the bottom, on the right, the subterranean
river bursts forth which Goldsmith mentions in his <i>Natural
History</i>.</p>

<p>The height of Ingleborough is 2361 feet. Its name is
supposed to be derived from <i>Ingle-burg</i>&mdash;a word which
embodies the idea of fire and fortress. It is a table-mountain,
with a top so flat and spacious that an encampment of more
than fifteen acres, of which the traces are still visible, was
established thereon, probably by the Brigantes, if not by an
earlier race. It is a landmark for vessels on the coast of
Lancashire. St. George&#x2019;s Channel is visible from the summit;
and one who has looked on the eastern sea from Flamborough
Head may find it convenient to remember that Yorkshire, on
its westernmost extremity, is but ten miles from the western sea.</p>

<p>In a short hour from Weathercote you come to the end of
the fells, an abrupt descent, all rough with crags and boulders,
where the view opens at once over the district of Craven,
and the little town of Ingleton is seen comfortably nestled
under the hill. Craven lies outspread in beauty&mdash;woods,
hills, fields, and pastures charming the eye of one who comes
from the untilled moors, and suggestive of delightful rambles
in store. The Ribble flows through it, watering many a
romantic cliff and wooded slope. And for the geologist,
Craven possesses especial interest, for it is intersected by what
he calls a &#x2018;fault,&#x2019; on the southern side of which the limestone
strata are thrown down a thousand feet.</p>

<p>I left Ingleton on the right, and turned off at the cross-roads
for Clapham, distant four miles. Here, as in other parts
of my travel, the miles seemed long&mdash;quite as long as they
were found to be years ago. We are told that when young
Daniel Dove walked dutifully every day to school, &#x201c;the
distance was in those days called two miles; but miles of such
long measure that they were for him a good hour&#x2019;s walk at a
cheerful pace.&#x201d; On the way from Mickle Fell to Brough I
met with a more unkindly experience; and that was an hour&#x2019;s
walking for a single mile.</p>

<p>The road undulating along the hill-side commands pleasing
views, and for one on foot is to be preferred to the new road,
which winds among the fields below. And with a brightening
evening we come to Clapham&mdash;a cheerful, pretty village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
adorned with flowers, and climbers, and smooth grass plots,
embowered by trees, and watered by a merry brook, lying
open to the sun on the roots of Ingleborough. Looking about
for an inn, I saw the <i>Bull and Cave</i>, and secured quarters
there by leaving my knapsack, and set out to seek for the
guide, whom I found chatting with a group of loungers on the
bridge. Bull and Cave seemed to me such an odd coupling,
that I fancied cave must be a Yorkshire way of spelling calf;
but it really means that which it purports, and the two words
are yoked together in order that visitors, who are numerous,
may be easily attracted.</p>

<p>Here in Clapdale&mdash;a dale which penetrates the slopes of
Ingleborough&mdash;is the famous Ingleborough Cave, the deepest
and most remarkable of all the caves hitherto discovered in
the honeycombed flanks of that remarkable hill. Intending
to see this, I left unvisited the other caves which have been
mentioned as lying to the right and left of the road as you
come down from <i>Gearstones</i>.</p>

<p>The fee for a single person to see the cave is half-a-crown;
for a party of eight or ten a shilling each. The guide, who
is an old soldier, and a good specimen of the class, civil and
intelligent, called at his house as we passed to get candles, and
presently we were clear of the village, and walking up-hill
along a narrow lane. Below us on the right lay cultivated
grounds and well-kept plantations, through which, as the old
man told me, visitors were once allowed to walk on their way
to the cave&mdash;a pleasing and much less toilsome way than the
lane; but the remains of picnics left on the grass, broken
bottles, orange-peels, greasy paper and wisps of hay, became
such a serious abuse of the privilege, that Mr. Farrer, the
proprietor, withdrew his permission. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a wonder to me,&#x201d;
said the guide, &#x201c;that people shouldn&#x2019;t know how to behave
themselves.&#x201d;</p>

<p>In about half an hour we came to a hollow between two
grassy acclivities, out of which runs a rapid beck, and here on
the left, in a limestone cliff prettily screened by trees, is the
entrance to the cave, a low, wide arch that narrows as it recedes
into the gloom. We walked in a few yards; the guide
lit two candles, placed one in my hand and unlocked the iron
gate, which, very properly, keeps out the perpetrators of
wanton mischief. A few paces take us beyond the last gleam
of daylight, and we are in a narrow passage, of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
sides and roof are covered with a brown incrustation resembling
gigantic clusters of petrified moss. Curious mushroom-like
growths hang from the roof, and throwing his light on
these, the guide says we are passing through the Inverted
Forest. So it continues, the roof still low, for eighty yards,
comprising the Old Cave, which has been known for ages;
and we come to a narrow passage hewn through a thick screen
of stalagmite. It was opened twenty years ago by Mr.
Farrer&#x2019;s gardener, who laboured at the barrier until it was
breached, and a new cavern of marvellous formation was discovered
beyond. An involuntary exclamation broke from me
as I entered and beheld what might have been taken for a
glittering fairy palace. On each side, sloping gently upwards
till they met the roof, great bulging masses of stalagmite of
snowy whiteness lay outspread, mound after mound glittering
as with millions of diamonds. For the convenience of explorers,
the passage between them has been widened and
levelled as far as possible, wherein the beck that we saw outside
finds a channel after unusual rains. You walk along this
passage now on sand, now on pebbles, now bare rock. All
the great white masses are damp; their surfaces are rough
with countless crystallized convolutions and minute ripples,
between which trickle here and there tiny threads of water.
It is to the moisture that the unsullied whiteness is due, and
the glistening effect; for wherever stalactite or stalagmite becomes
dry, the colour changes to brown, as we saw in the Old
Cave. A strange illusion came over me as I paced slowly
past the undulating ranges, and for a moment they seemed to
represent the great rounded snow-fields that whiten the sides
of the Alps.</p>

<p>The cavern widens: we are in the Pillar Hall; stalactites
of all dimensions hang from the roof, singly and in groups.
Thousands are mere nipples, or an inch or two in length;
many are two or three feet; and the whole place resounds
with the drip and tinkle of water. Stalagmites dot the floor,
and while some have grown upwards the stalactites have
grown downwards, until the ends meet, and the ceaseless
trickle of water fashions an unbroken crystal pillar. Some
stalactites assume a spiral twist; and where a long thin fissure
occurs in the roof they take the form of draperies, curtains,
and wings&mdash;wings shaped like those of angels. The guide
strikes one of the wings with a small mallet, and it gives out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
a rich musical note; another has the deep sonorous boom of a
cathedral bell, another rings sharp and shrill, and a row of
stalactitic sheets answers when touched with a gamut of notes.
Your imagination grows restless while you listen to such
strange music deep in the heart of a mountain.</p>

<p>And there are pools on the floor, and in raised basins at the
side&mdash;pools of water so limpid as to be treacherous, for in the
uncertain light all appears to be solid rock. I stepped knee
deep into one, mistaking it for an even floor. Well for me it
was not the Abyss which yawns at the end of Pillar Hall.
The guide, to show the effect of light reflected on the water,
crawls up to the end of one of the basins with the two
candles in his hand, while you standing in the gloom at the
other end, observe the smooth brilliant surface, and the brightness
that flashes from every prominence of roof or wall.</p>

<p>Although geologists explain the process of formation, there
is yet much food for wonder in remembering that all these
various objects were formed by running water. The water,
finding its way through fissures in the mighty bed of limestone
overhead, hangs in drops, one drop pushes another off,
but not idly; for while the current of air blowing through
carries off their carbonic acid, they give up the salt of lime
gathered during percolation, and form small stony tubes. And
these tubes, the same cause continuing to operate, grow in
course of ages to magnificent stalactites; and where thin,
broad streams have appeared, there the draperies and wings
and the great snow-fields have been fashioned. The incrustation
spreads even over some of the pools: the film of water
flowing in deposits its solid contents on the margin, and these,
crystallizing and accumulating, advance upon the surface, as
ice forms from the edge towards the centre of a pond, and in
time bridge it over with a translucent sheet.</p>

<p>Among the stalagmites are a few of beehive shape; but
there is one named the Jockey Cap, an extraordinary specimen
for bigness. Its base has a circumference of ten feet, its
height is two feet, all produced by a succession of drops from
one single point. Advantage has been taken of this circumstance
to measure the rate of its growth. Mr. Farrer collected
a pint of drops, and ascertained the fall to be one hundred
pints a day, each pint containing one grain of calcareous
matter; and from this daily supply of a hundred grains the
Jockey Cap was built up to its present dimensions in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
hundred and fifty-nine years. In six years, from 1845 to
1851, the diameter increased by two, and the height by three
inches. Probably owing to the morning&#x2019;s rain, the drops fell
rapidly while I stood looking at the cap&mdash;splash&mdash;splash&mdash;splash&mdash;into
a small saucer-like depression in the middle of
the crown, from which with ceaseless overflow the water
bathes the entire mass. Around it is the most drippy part of
the cave.</p>

<p>In places there are sudden breaks in the roof at right angles
to the passage&mdash;cracks produced by the cooling of this great
limestone bubble in the primeval days&mdash;which look as if
Nature had begun to form a series of cross aisles, and then
held her hand. Some of these are nests of stalactites; one
exhibits architectural forms adorned with beads and mouldings
as if sculptured in purest marble. The farther you penetrate
the loftier do they become; impressing you with the idea that
they are but the ante-chambers of some majestic temple
farther within. The Abyss appears to be a similar arch reversed
in the floor.</p>

<p>Then we came to a bend where the roof rushing down
appears to bar all further advance, but the guide puts a thing
into your hand which you might take to be a scrubbing-brush,
and telling you to stoop, creeps into a low opening between
the rising floor and descending roof, and you discover that the
scrubbing-brush is a paddle to enable you to walk on three
legs while crouching down. It keeps your right hand from
the slippery rock; and your left has always enough to do in
holding the candle. The creeping continues but for a few
yards, and you emerge into one of the cross vaults, and again
sand and pebbles form the floor. Then comes the Cellar
Gallery, a long tunnel-like passage, the sides perpendicular,
the roof arched, which, like all the rest, has been shaped by
currents of water, aided in this case by the grinding action of
sand and pebbles. Continuing through thousands of years,
the result is as we behold it. The tunnel appears the more
gloomy from the absence of ornament: no stalactites, no
wings, reflect the dim candle-flame; for which reason, as well
as to avoid the creeping, many visitors refuse to advance
beyond the entrance of the Long Gallery. But the tunnel
leads you into the Giant&#x2019;s Hall, where stalactites and draperies
again meet your eye, and where your light is all too feeble to
illumine the lofty roof. And here is the end, 2106 feet from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the entrance&mdash;nearly half a mile. From the time that the
gardener broke through the barrier in the Old Cave, two years
were spent in gradual advances till the Giant&#x2019;s Hall was
reached. The adventurous explorers endeavoured to get
farther, for two small holes were discovered leading downwards
from one side of the Hall to a lower cave, through
which arose the sound of falling water. They braved the
danger, and let themselves down to a level, where they were
stopped by a deep pool&mdash;the receiver of the fall. It must have
looked fearfully dismal. Yet might there not be caverns still
more wonderful beyond? Fixing a candle to his cap and with
a rope round his body, Mr. James Farrer swam across the
murky lake, and found it closed in by what appeared to be an
impassable wall of limestone&mdash;the heart of Ingleborough. It
was a courageous adventure.</p>

<p>I stretched out my candle and peered down the two holes.
One is dry and sandy, the other slimy with a constant drip.
I heard the noise of the fall, the voice of the water plunging
for ever, night and day, in deep darkness. It seemed awful.
A current of air blows forth continually, whereby the cave
is ventilated throughout its entire length, and the visitor,
safe from stagnant damps and stifling vapours, breathes freely
in a pure atmosphere.</p>

<p>I walked once more from end to end of the Hall; and we
retraced our steps. In the first cross aisle the guide made
me aware of an echo which came back to the ear as a hollow
moan. We crept through into Pillar Hall, and I could not
help lingering once more to admire the brilliant and delicate
incrustations, and to scramble between or over the great
stalagmitic barriers to see what was in the rear. Here and
there I saw a mass resembling a font, filled with water of
exquisite purity, or raised oval or oblong basins representing
alabaster baths, wherein none but vestal virgins might enter.</p>

<p>Except that the path has been levelled and widened, and
openings enlarged, and planks laid in one place to facilitate
access to a change of level, the cave remains as when first
discovered. Mr. Farrer&#x2019;s precautions against mischief have
prevented that pillage of the interior so much to be deplored
in other caves of this region, where the first-comers made
prize of all the ornaments within reach, and left little but
bare walls for those who follow. Yet even here some of the
smaller stalactites, the size of a finger, have been missed after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
a party has gone through; and once a man struck a group of
stalactites and broke more than a foot off the longest, in sheer
wantonness, as it seemed, for the fragment was too heavy to
carry away. And there the mutilation remains, a lasting
reproach to a fool.</p>

<p>My candle burnt out, and the other flickered near its end,
but the old man had two halves which he lit, and these more
than sufficed for our return. The red light of sunset was
streaming into the entrance when we came forth after a
sojourn of nearly two hours in the bowels of the mountain.
The guide had been very indulgent with me; for most visitors
stay but an hour. Those who merely wish to walk through,
content with a hasty glance, will find little to impede their
movements. There is nothing, indeed, which need deter a
woman, only she must leave her hoop at home, wear thick
boots, and make provision for looping-up her skirts. Many
an English maiden would then enjoy a visit to Ingleborough
Cave.</p>

<p>The beck flows out from under the cliff a few yards above
the entrance through a broad low vault. I crept in for some
distance, and it seemed to me that access to the cave might be
gained by wading up the stream. Then as we went down
the hill, the old soldier thought that as there were but two of
us, we might venture to walk through the grounds, where we
saw the lake, the bridge, and the cascade, on our way to the
village.</p>

<p>Delicious trout from the neighbouring brook, and most
excellent beer, awaited me for supper, and made me well
content with the <i>Bull and Cave</i>. Afterwards I joined the
party in the little bar-parlour, where among a variety of
topics, the mountain was talked about. The landlord, a hale
old fellow of sixty, said that he had never once been on the
summit, though he had lived all his life at the base. A rustic,
though a two years&#x2019; resident in Clapham, had not been up, and
for a reason: &#x201c;You see,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;if a man gets on a high
place, he isn&#x2019;t satisfied then; he wants to get higher. So I
thinks best to content myself down here.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Then spoke another of the party, a man well dressed, in
praise of rural quiet, and the enjoyment of fresh air, contrasting
the tranquillity of Clapham at that hour with the noise
and confusion at Bradford, where the streets would be thronged
till after midnight. He was an &#x2018;operative&#x2019; from Bradford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
come as was his wont, to spend Sunday in the country. He
grew eloquent on the subject of masters and men, averring
that masters, as a body, would never do anything for the
benefit of workmen unless compelled thereto by act of Parliament.
Well might he say so. Would the mills be ventilated;
would dangerous machinery be boxed off; would schools have
been interposed between children and slavery, had Parliament
not interfered? The number of Yorkshire factory children
at school on the last day of October, 1857, was 18,000, from
eight to thirteen years of age. On this latter particular our
spinner could not say enough in praise of the House of Commons:
there was a chance for the bairns now that the law
punished the masters who did not allow time for school as well
as for work. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of the grandest things,&#x201d; he said,
&#x201c;Parliament ever did for the factory hands.&#x201d;</p>

<p>He had too much reason to speak as he did; but we must
not suppose that the great millowners are worse than other
masters. Owing to the large numbers they employ, the evils
complained of appear in a violent and concentrated form;
but we have only to look at the way in which apprentices and
domestic servants are treated everywhere, especially in large
towns (with comparatively few exceptions,) to become aware
that a want of fair-play is by far too prevalent. No wonder
that Dr. Livingstone finds reason to say we are not model
Christians.</p>

<p>The railway station at Clapham, as well as others along the
line, is built in the old timbered style, and harmonizes well
with the landscape. A railway hotel stands close by, invitingly
open to guests who dislike the walk of a mile to the
village; and the landlord, as I was told, multiplies his profits
by renting the Cave.</p>

<p>A short flight by the first train took me to breakfast at
Skipton, all through the pretty country of Craven, of which
the town is the capital. The houses are built of stone taken
from the neighbouring hills. The bells were just beginning
their chimes as I passed the church, and, seeing the door open,
I went in and looked at the stained glass and old monuments,
the shields and sculptures which commemorate the Cliffords&mdash;Lords
of the Honour of Skipton&mdash;the Lady Ellinor, of the
house of Brandon; the Earls of Cumberland, one of whom was
Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s champion against the Spaniard, as well as
in tilt and tournament.</p>

<p>The castle, which has played a conspicuous part in history,
stands beside the church, and there, over the gateway, you
may still see the shield bearing two griffins, and the motto
<span class="blackletter">Desormais</span>. Within, you view the massive, low, round
towers from a pleasant garden, where but few signs of antiquity
are to be seen; for modern restorations have masked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the old grim features. Here dwelt the Cliffords, a proud
and mighty family, who made a noise in the world, in their
day. Among them was Lord John, or Black Clifford, who
did butcher-work at the battle of Wakefield, and was
repaid the year after at Towton. In the first year of
Edward IV. the estates were forfeited because of high
treason, and Henry, the tenth Lord of the Honour of Skipton,
to escape the ill consequence of his father&#x2019;s disloyalty, was
concealed for twenty-five years among the shepherds of
Cumberland. Another of the line was that imperial-minded
Countess, the Lady Anne Clifford, who, when she repaired
her castle of Skipton, made it known by an inscription in the
same terms as that set up on her castle at Brough, and with
the same passage of Scripture. Now it is a private residence;
and the ancient tapestries and pictures, and other curiosities
which are still preserved, can only be seen after due pains
taken by the inquiring visitor.</p>

<p>The life of the Shepherd Lord, as he was called, is a touching
episode in the history of the Cliffords; heightened by the
marked contrast between the father and son&mdash;the one warlike
and revengeful, the other gentle and forgiving. We shall
come again on the traces of the pastoral chief ere the day be
over.</p>

<p>There is a long stretch of the old castle wall on the left as
you go up the road towards Knaresborough. From the top
of the hill, looking back about a mile and a half distant, you
get a pleasing view of Skipton, lying in its cheerful green
valley; and presently, in the other direction, you see the hills
of Wharfedale. Everywhere the grass is waving, or, newly-mown,
fills all the air with delightful odour. I walked
slowly, for the day was hot&mdash;one of the hottest of that fervid
July&mdash;and took till noon to accomplish the seven miles to
Bolton Abbey. The number of vehicles drawn up at the
<i>Devonshire Arms</i>&mdash;a good inn about two furlongs from the
ruin&mdash;and the numerous visitors, betokened something
unusually attractive.</p>

<p>Since Landseer painted his picture, Bolton Abbey has
become a household word. It seems familiar to us beforehand.
We picture it to our minds; and your imagination
must be extravagant indeed if the picture be not realized.
It is a charming scene that opens as you turn out of the road
and descend the grassy slope: the abbey standing, proud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
beautiful in decay, in a green meadow, where stately trees
adorn the gentle undulations; the Wharfe rippling cheerfully
past, coming forth from wooded hills above, going away between
wooded hills below, alike</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;With mazy error under pendent shades;&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the bold perpendicular cliff opposite, all purple and gray,
crowned and flanked with hanging wood; the cascade rushing
down in a narrow line of foam; the big mossy stones that line
the bank, and the stony islets in the bed of the stream; and,
looking up the dale, the great sweeps of wood in Bolton Park,
terminated by the wild heights of Symon Seat and Barden
Fell. All around you see encircling woods, and combinations
of rock, and wood, and water, that inspire delightful emotions.</p>

<p>But you will turn again and again to the abbey to gaze on
its tall arches, the great empty window, the crumbling walls,
over which hang rich masses of ivy, and walking slowly
round you will discover the points whence the ruins appear
most picturesque. And within, where elder-trees grow, and
the carved tombstones of the old abbots lie on the turf, you
may still see where the monks sat in the sanctuary, and
where they poured the holy water. And whether from within
or without, you will survey with reverent admiration. A
part of the nave is used as a church for the neighbourhood,
and ere I left, the country folk came from all the paths around,
summoned by the pealing bell. I looked in and saw richly
stained windows and old tombs.</p>

<p>On the rise above the abbey stands a castellated lodge, embodying
the ancient gate-house, an occasional resort of the late
Duke of Devonshire, to whom the estate belonged. Of all his
possessions this perhaps offered him most of beauty and
tranquillity.</p>

<p>You may ramble at will; cross the long row of stepping-stones
to the opposite bank, and scramble through the wood
to the top of the cliff; or roam over the meadows up and
down the river, or lounge in idle enjoyment on the seats fixed
under some of the trees. After strolling hither and thither,
I concealed myself under the branches overhanging the stream,
and sat there as in a bower, with my feet in the shallow
water, the lively flashing current broad before me, and read,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;From Bolton&#x2019;s old monastic tower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bells ring loud with gladsome power;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, up among the moorlands, see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What sprinklings of blithe company!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And while I read, the bell was ringing, and the people
were gathering together, and anon the priest</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&#x201c;all tranquilly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recites the holy liturgy,&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but no White Doe of Rylstone came gliding down to pace
timidly among the tombs, and make her couch on a solitary
grave.</p>

<p>And reading there on the scene itself, I found a new charm
in the pages&mdash;a vivid life in the old events and old names:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Pass, pass who will, yon chantry door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the chink in the fractured floor<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Look down among them, if you dare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft does the White Doe loiter there.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And here, as at Skipton, we are reminded of the Cliffords,
and of the Shepherd Lord, to whom appeared at times the
gracious fairy,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;And taught him signs, and showed him sights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Craven&#x2019;s dens, on Cumbrian heights;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When under a cloud of fear he lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shepherd clad in homely gray.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I left my mossy seat and returned to the bank, thoroughly
cooled, on coming to the end of the poem, and started for a
travel up the dale. The road skirts the edge of Bolton Park;
but the pleasantest way is through the park itself, for there
you have grand wooded slopes on each side, and there the
river rushing along its limestone bed encounters the far-famed
Strid. A rustic, however, told me that no one was allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
cross the park on Sunday; but having come to see a sight, I
did not like to be disappointed, and thought it best to test the
question myself. I kept on, therefore, passing from the open
grounds to delightful paths under the woods, bending hither
and thither, and with many a rise and fall among rocks and
trees. Presently, guided by the roar, I struck through the
wood for the stony margin of the river. Here all is rock:
great hummocks, ledges and tables of rock, wherein are deep
basins, gullies, bays, and shallow pools; and the water makes
a loud noise as it struggles past. Here and there a rugged
cliff appears, its base buried in underwood, its front hung
with ivy; and there are marks on the trees, and portentous
signs on the drifted boulders, which reveal the swollen height
of floods. There are times when all these Yorkshire rivers
become impetuous torrents, roaring along in resistless might
and majesty.</p>

<p>A little farther and the rocks form a dam, leaving but a
narrow opening in the centre, across which a man may stride,
for the passage of the stream&mdash;and we behold the Strid. Piling
itself up against the barrier, the water rushes through, deep,
swift and ungovernable, and boils and eddies below with
never-ceasing tumult. The rock on each side of the sluice is
worn smooth by the feet of many who have stridden across,
caring nothing for the tales that are told of terrible accidents
from a slip of the foot or from giddiness. Once a young lady,
fascinated by the rapid current, fell in and was drowned in
sight of her friends. And</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">To days of dim antiquity;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A pious structure, fair to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose up, the stately Priory!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For about a mile upwards the river-bed is still rocky, and
you see many a pretty effect of rushing water, and perhaps
half a dozen strids, but not one with only a single sluice, as the
first. No one stopped or turned me back; no peremptory
shout threatened me from afar; and truly the river is so shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in by woods, that intruders could only be seen by an eye
somewhere on its brink. Not a soul did I meet, except three
countrymen, who, when I came suddenly upon them on
doubling a crag, seemed ready to take to flight, for instead of
coming the beaten way to view the romantic, they had got
over the fence, and scrambled down through the wood. They
soon perceived that I was very harmless.</p>

<p>A little farther and we leave the rocks; the woods recede
and give place to broad grassy slopes; high up on the right
stands the keeper&#x2019;s house; higher on the left the old square
block of Barden Tower peeps above the trees; before us a
bridge spans the river, and there we pass into the road which
leads through the village of Barden to Pateley Bridge and
Nidderdale.</p>

<p>The Wharfe has its source in the bleak moorlands which
we saw flanking Cam Fell during our descent from Counterside
a few days ago. Rocks and cliffs of various formations
beset all its upper course, imparting a different character to
the dale every few leagues&mdash;savage, romantic, picturesque,
and beautiful. No more beautiful scenery is to be found
along the river than for some miles above and below Bolton
Abbey. Five miles farther down, the stream flows past those
two delightful inland watering-places, Ilkley and Ben Rhydding,
and onwards between thick woods and broad meadows
to Wetherby, below which it is again narrowed by cliffs, until
leaving Tadcaster, rich in memories of Rome, it enters the
Ouse between Selby and York.</p>

<p>The sight of Barden Tower reminds us once more of the
Shepherd Lord, for there he oft did sojourn, enjoying rural
scenes and philosophical studies, even after his restoration to
rank and estate in his thirty-second year.</p>

<p>But the blood of his ancestors flowed in his veins, and on
the royal summons to arm and array for Flodden, he, at the
age of sixty, led his retainers to the field:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;From Penigent to Pendle Hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Linton to Long Addingham,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that Craven coasts did till,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They with the lusty Clifford came.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I crossed the bridge and went up the hill for a view of the
ruin. At the top, a broken slope, sprinkled with trees, serves
as village green to the few houses which constitute the place
known as Barden Tower. Near one of these houses I saw a
pretty sight&mdash;a youth sitting on a bench under a shady tree
reading to his old grandfather from one of those venerable
folios written by divines whose head and heart were alike full
of their subject&mdash;the ways of God towards man, and man&#x2019;s
duty. Wishing to make an inquiry concerning the road, I
apologized for my interruption, when both graybeard and lad
made room for me between them on the bench, and proffered
all they knew of information. But it soon appeared that the
particulars I wanted could only be furnished by &#x201c;uncle, who
was up-stairs a-cleaning himself;&#x201d; so to improve the time
until he was ready I passed round the end of the house to the
Tower in the rear. The old gateway remains, and some of
the ancient timbers; but the upper chambers are now used as
lofts for firewood, and the ground-floor is a cow-stall. The
external walls are comparatively but little decayed, and appear
in places as strong as when they sheltered the Cliffords.</p>

<p>Uncle was there when I returned to the front. He knew
the country well, for in his vocation as a butcher he travelled
it every week, and enabled me to decide between Kettlewell
and Pateley Bridge for my coming route. And more, he said
he would like to walk a mile or two with me; he would put
on his coat, and soon overtake me. I walked slowly on, and
was out of sight of the house, when he came running after
me, and cried, &#x201c;Hey! come back. A cup o&#x2019; tea &#x2019;ll do neither
of us any harm, so come back and have a cup afore we start.&#x201d;</p>

<p>I went back, for such hospitality as that was not to be
slighted; and while we sipped he talked about the pretty
scenery, about the rooms which he had to let, and the lodgers
he had entertained. Sometimes there came a young couple
full of poetry and sentiment, too much so, indeed, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
merry; sometimes a student, who liked to prowl about the
ruin, explore all its secrets, and wander out to where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;High on a point of rugged ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the wastes of Rylstone Fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the loftiest ridge or mound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where foresters or shepherds dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An edifice of warlike frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands single&mdash;Norton tower its name&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It fronts all quarters, and looks round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#x2019;er path and road, and plain and dell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark moor, and gleam of pool and stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a prospect without bound.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And he talked, too, about the trout in the river, and the
anglers who came to catch them. But the fishing is not
unrestricted; leave must be obtained, and a fee paid. Anyone
in search of trout or the picturesque, who can content
himself with rustic quarters, would find in Mr. Williamson,
of Barden Tower, a willing adviser.</p>

<p>Presently we took the road, which, with the river on the
right, runs along the hill-side, sheltered by woods, high above
the stream. A few minutes brought us to a gate, where we
got over, and went a little way down the slope to look at
Gale beck, a pretty cascade tumbling into a little dell, delightfully
cool, and green with trees, ferns, and mosses. My companion
showed that he used his eyes while driving about in
his cart, and picked out the choice bits of the scenery;
and these he now pointed out to me with all the pride of one
who had a personal interest in their reputation. Ere long we
emerged from the trees, and could overlook the pleasing
features of the dale; fields and meadows on each side of the
stream, bounded by steep hills, and crags peeping out from the
great dark slopes of firs. The rocky summit of Symon Seat
appeared above a brow on the left bank, coming more and
more into view as we advanced, till the great hill itself was
unveiled. From those rocks, on a clear day, you can see
Rosebury Topping, and the towers of York and Ripon.</p>

<p>For four miles did my entertainer accompany me, which,
considering the fierce heat of the evening, I could only regard
as an honest manifestation of friendliness&mdash;to me very gratifying.
We parted in sight of Burnsall, a village situate on
the fork of the river, where the Littondale branch joins that
of Wharfedale proper.</p>

<p>A man who sat reading at his door near the farther end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the village looked up as I passed, and asked, &#x201c;Will ye have a
drink o&#x2019; porter?&#x201d; Hot weather justified acceptance; he invited
me to sit while he went to the barrel, and when he
came forth with the foaming jug, he, too, must have a talk.
But his talk was not what I expected&mdash;the simple words of a
simple-minded rustic; he craved to know something, and
more than was good, concerning a certain class of publications
sold in Holywell-street; things long ago condemned by the
moral law, and now very properly brought under the lash of
the legal law by Lord Campbell. Having no mission to be a
scavenger, I advised him not to meddle with pitch; but he
already knew too much, and he mentioned things which help
to explain the great demand for the immoral books out of the
metropolis. One was, that in a small northern, innocent-looking
country town, Adam and Eve balls regularly take
place, open to all comers who can pay for admission.</p>

<p>From Burnsall onwards we have again the grass country,
the landscape loses the softened character of that in our rear;
we follow a bad cross-road for some miles, passing wide apart
a solitary farm or cottage, and come into a high-road a little
to the right of Threshfield. Here and there a group of
labourers are lounging on a grassy bank, smoking, talking
quietly, and enjoying the sunset coolness; and I had more
than one invitation to tarry and take a friendly pipe.</p>

<p>Louder sounds the noise of the river as the evening lengthens;
the dark patches of firs on the hill-sides grow darker;
the rocks and cliffs look strange and uncertain; the road
approaches a foaming rapid, where another strid makes the
water roar impatiently; and so I completed the ten miles
from Harden Tower, and came in deep twilight to the <i>Anglers&#x2019;
Inn</i> at Kilnsey as the good folk were preparing for bed.</p>

<p>As its name denotes, the house is frequented by anglers,
who, after paying a fee of half-a-crown a day, find exercise
for their skill in the rippling shallows and silent pools of the
river which flows past not many yards from the road. I am
told that the sport is but indifferent.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond the inn there rises sheer from the
road a grand limestone cliff, before which you will be tempted
to pause. A low grassy slope, bordered by a narrow brook,
forms a natural plinth; small trees and ivy grow from the
fissures high overhead, and large trees and bush on the ledges;
the colony of swallows that inhabit the holes flit swiftly about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the crest, and what with the contrast of verdure and rock, and
the magnitude of the cliff, your eye is alike impressed and
gratified. By taking a little trouble you may get to the top,
and while looking on the scene beneath, let your thoughts run
back to the time when Wharfedale was a loch, such as Loch
Long or Loch Fyne, into which the tides of the sea flowed
twice a day, beating against the base of the Kilnsey Crag,
where now sheep graze, and men pass to and fro on business
or pleasure.</p>

<p>To take my start the next morning from so lofty a headland:
to feel new life thrill through every limb from the early
sun; to drink of the spring which the cliff overshadows where
it gushes forth among mossy stones at the root of an ash; to
inhale the glorious breeze that tempered the heat, was a
delightful beginning of a day&#x2019;s walk. Soon we cross to the
left bank of Wharfe, and follow the road between the river
and a cliffy range of rocks to Kettlewell, enjoying pleasing
views all the way. And the village itself seems a picture of
an earlier age&mdash;a street of little stone cottages, backed by gardens
and orchards; here and there a queer little shop; the
shoemaker sitting with doors and windows open looking out
on his flowers every time he lifts his eyes; the smith, who
has opened all his shutters to admit the breeze, hammering
leisurely, as if half inclined for a holiday with such a wealth
of sunshine pouring down; and <i>Nancy Hardaker, Grocer and
Draper</i>, and dealer in everything besides, busying herself
behind her little panes with little preparations for customers.
It is a simple picture: one that makes you believe the honest
outward aspect is only the expression of honesty within.</p>

<p>For one who had time to explore the neighbourhood, Kettlewell
would be good head-quarters. It has two inns, and a
shabby tenement inscribed <i>Temperance Hotel</i>. Hence you may
penetrate to the wild fells at the head of the dale; or climb
to the top of Great Whernside; or ramble over the shoulder
of the great mountain into Coverdale, discovering many a
rocky nook, and many a little cascade and flashing rill. Great
Whernside, 2263 feet high, commands views into many dales,
and affords you a glimpse of far-off hills which we have
already climbed. The Great one has a brother named Little
Whernside, because he is not so high by nearly three hundred
feet. The &#x201c;limestone pass&#x201d; between Great Whernside and
Buckden Pike is described as a grand bit of mountain scenery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>From Kettlewell the road still ascends the dale, in sight of
the river which now narrows to the dimensions of a brook.
Crags and cliffs still break out of the hill-slopes, and more
than any other that we have visited, you see that Wharfedale
is characterized by scars and cliffs. The changing aspect of
the scenery is manifest; the grass is less luxuriant than lower
down, and but few of the fields are mown. Starbottom, a
little place of rude stone houses, with porches that resemble
an outer stair, reminds us once more of a mountain village;
but it has trim flower-gardens, and fruit-trees, and a fringe of
sycamores.</p>

<p>I came to Buckden, the next village, just in time to dine
with the haymakers. Right good fare was provided&mdash;roast
mutton, salad, and rice pudding. Who would not be a hay-maker!
Beyond the village the road turns away from the
river, and mounts a steep hill, where, from the top of the
bend, we get our last look down Wharfedale, upwards along
Langstrothdale, and across the elevated moorlands which
enclose Penyghent. Everywhere the gray masses of stone
encroach on the waving grass. Still the road mounts, and
steeply; on the left, in a field, are a few small enclosures, all
standing, which, perhaps, represent the British dwellings at
the foot of Addleborough. Still up, through the hamlet of
Cray, with rills, rocks, and waterfalls on the right and left,
and then the crown of the pass, and a wide ridgy hollow,
flanked by cliffs, the outliers of Buckden Pike, which rears
itself aloft on the right. Then two or three miles of this
breezy expanse, between Stake Fell on one side and Wasset
Fell on the other, and we come to the top of Kidstone bank,
and suddenly Bishopdale opens before us, a lovely sylvan
landscape melting away into Wensleydale. It will tempt you
to lie down for half an hour on the soft turf and enjoy the
prospect at leisure.</p>

<p>The descent is alike rough and steep, bringing you rapidly
down to the first farm. A cliff on the right gradually merges
into the rounded swell of a green hill; we come to a plantation
where, in the open places by the beck, grow wild strawberries;
then to trees on one side&mdash;ash, holly, beech, and
larch, the stems embraced by ivy, and thorns and wild roses
between; then trees on both sides, and the narrow track is
beautiful as a Berkshire lane&mdash;and that is saying a great deal&mdash;and
the brook which accompanies it makes a cheerful sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
as if gladdened by the quivering sunbeams that fall upon it.
Everywhere the haymakers are at work, and with merry
hearts, for the wind blows lustily and makes the whole dale
vocal.</p>

<p>By-and-by the lane sends off branches, all alike pretty, one
of which brings us down into the lowest meadows, and on the
descent we get glimpses of Bolton Castle, and on the right
appears Penhill, shouldering forward like a great promontory.
A relic of antiquity may yet be seen on its slopes&mdash;obscure
remains of a Preceptory of the Knights Templars. The
watcher on Penhill was one of those who helped to spread the
alarm of invasion in the days of Napoleon the Great, for he
mistook a fire on the eastern hills for the beacon on Rosebury
Topping, and so set his own a-blaze. We come to Thoralby,
a village of comfortable signs within, and pleasant prospects
without; and now Wensleydale opens, and another half-hour
brings us to Aysgarth, a large village four miles below Bainbridge.</p>

<p>A tall maypole stands on the green, the only one I remember
to have seen in Yorkshire. It is a memorial of the sports
and pastimes for which Wensleydale was famous. The annual
feasts and fairs would attract visitors from twenty miles
around. Here, at Aysgarth, not the least popular part of the
amusements were the races, run by men stark naked, as people
not more than forty years old can well remember. But
times are changed; and throughout the dale drunkenness and
revelry are giving way to teetotalism, lectures, tea-gatherings,
and other moral recreations. And the change is noticeable in
another particular: the Quakers, who were once numerous in
the dale, have disappeared too.</p>

<p>Some two or three years ago a notion prevailed in a certain
quarter that the time was ripe for making proselytes, and establishing
a meeting once more at Aysgarth. The old meeting-house,
the school-room, and dwelling-house, remained; why
should they not be restored to their original uses? Was it
not &#x201c;about Wensleydale&#x201d; that George Fox saw &#x201c;a great
people in white raiment by a river-side?&#x201d; Did he not, while
on his journey up the dale, go into the &#x201c;steeple-house&#x201d; and
&#x201c;largely and freely declare the word of life, and have not
much persecution,&#x201d; and afterwards was locked into a parlour
as &#x201c;a young man that was mad, and had run away from his
relations?&#x201d; From certain indications it seemed that a suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>cessful
effort might be made; an earnest and active member
of the society volunteered to remove with his family from
London into Yorkshire to carry out the experiment; and soon
the buildings were repaired, the garden was cultivated anew,
the doors of the meeting-house were opened; the apostle went
about and talked to the people, and gave away tracts freely.
The people listened to him, and read his tracts, and were well
content to have him among them; but the experiment failed&mdash;not
one became a Quaker.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the present year (1858) an essay was
advertised for, on the causes of the decline of Quakerism,
simultaneously with a great increase in the population at large.
It appears to me that the causes are not far to seek. One of
them I have already mentioned: others consist in what
Friends call a &#x201c;guarded education,&#x201d; which seeks rather to
ignore vice than to implant abhorrence of it; in training
children by a false standard: &#x201c;Do this; don&#x2019;t do that;&#x201d; not
because it is right or wrong, but because such is or is not the
practice of Friends, so that when the children grow old enough
to see what a very foolish Mrs. Grundy they have had set
before them as a model, they naturally suspect imposition,
become restive, and kick over the traces. Moreover, to set up
fidgetty crotchets as principles of truth, whereby the sense of
the ludicrous is excited in others, and not reverence, is not the
way to increase and multiply. Many Quakers now living will
remember the earnest controversy that once stirred them as to
whether it might be proper to use umbrellas, and to wear hats
with a binding round the edge of the brim; and the anxious
breeches question, of which a ministress said in her sermon,
that it was &#x201c;matter of concern to see so many of the young
men running down into longs, yet the Lord be thanked, there
was a precious remnant left in shorts.&#x201d; And again, silent
worship tends to diminish numbers, as also the exceeding
weakness&mdash;with rare exceptions&mdash;of the words that occasionally
break the silence; and the absence of an external motive
to fix the attention encourages roving thoughts. Hence Darlington
railway-shares, and the shop-shelves, and plans for
arbours and garden-plots, employ the minds of many who
might have other thoughts did they hear&mdash;&#x201c;Be not deceived,
God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall
he also reap.&#x201d;</p>

<p>There is my essay. It is a short one, freely given; for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
must confess to a certain liking for the Quakers, after all.
Their charities are noble and generous; their views on many
points eminently liberal and enlightened; and though themselves
enslaved to crotchets, they have shown bravely and
practically that they abhor slavery; and their recent mission
to Finland demonstrates the bounty and tenderness with
which they seek to mitigate the evils of war. There is in
Oxfordshire a little Quaker burial-ground, on the brow of a
hill looking far away into the west country, where I have
asked leave to have my grave dug, when the time comes:
that is, if the sedate folk will admit among them even a dead
Philistine.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I saw the Quaker above-mentioned standing at his door:
we were total strangers to each other, but my Bainbridge
friend had told him there was a chance of my visiting Aysgarth,
and he held out his hand. Soon tea was made ready,
and after that he called his son, and led me across the hill-slopes
to get the best views, and by short cuts down to Aysgarth
Force, a mile below the village, where the Ure rushes
down three great breaks or steps in the limestone which
stretch all across the river. The water is shallow, and falling
as a white curtain over the front of each step, shoots swiftly
over the broad level to the next plunge, and the next, producing,
even in dry weather, a very pleasing effect. But
during a flood the steps disappear, and the whole channel is
filled by one great rapid, almost terrific in its vehemence.
The stony margin of the stream is fretted and worn into many
curious forms, and for a mile or more above and below the
bed is stone&mdash;nothing but stone&mdash;while on each side the steep
banks are patched and clothed with trees and bush. The
broken ground above the Force, interspersed with bush, is a
favourite resort of picnic parties, and had been thronged a few
days before by a multitude of festive teetotallers.</p>

<p>The bridge which crosses the river between the Force and
the village, with its arch of seventy-one feet span springing
from two natural piers of limestone, is a remarkably fine
object when viewed from below. Above, the river flows
noisily from ledge to ledge down a winding gorge.</p>

<p>Drunken Barnaby, who, by the way, was a Yorkshireman,
named Richard Braithwaite, came to Wensleydale in one of
his itineraries. &#x201c;Thence,&#x201d; says the merry fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The church stands in a commanding position, whence there
is a good prospect down the dale. Besides the landscape,
there are times when the daring innovations made by fashion
on the old habits may be observed. Wait in the churchyard
on Sunday when service ends, and you will see many a gay
skirt, hung with flounces and outspread by crinoline, come
flaunting forth from the church. And in this remote village,
Miss Metcalfe and Miss Thistlethwaite must do the bidding
of coquettish Parisian milliners, even as their sisters do in
May Fair.</p>

<p>My friend had for some time wished to look into Swaledale;
he therefore accompanied me the next morning, as far as the
route served, through the village of Carperby, where dwells a
Quaker who has the best grazing farm in the North Riding.
We passed without calling, for he must be a philosopher
indeed, here in the dales, who can endure interruptions in
hay-time, when all who can work are busy in the fields. Ask
no man to lend you a horse or labourer in hay-time. Servants
give themselves leave in hay-time, and go toiling in the sunshine
till all the crop is led, earning as much out of doors in
three or four weeks as in six months in-doors. What is it to
them that the mistress has to buckle-to, and be her own
servant for a while, and see to the washing, and make the
bread? as I saw in my friend&#x2019;s house, knowing that in case
of failure the nearest place where a joint of meat or a loaf of
bread can be got is at Hawes, eight miles distant. What is
it to them? the hay must be made, whether or not.</p>

<p>A few light showers fell, refreshing the thirsty soil, and
making the trees and hedgerows rejoice in a livelier green.
It was as if Summer were overjoyed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanzawide">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Even when she weeps, as oft she will, though surely not for grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tears are turned to diamond drops on every shining leaf.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>so our walk of four miles to Bolton Castle was the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
agreeable. The old square building, with its four square
towers rising above a mass of wood, looks well as you approach
from the road; and when you come upon the eminence
on which it stands, and see the little village of Bolton, little
thatched cottages bordering the green, as old in appearance as
the castle, it is as if you looked on a scene from the feudal
ages&mdash;the rude dwellings of the serfs pitched for safety beneath
the walls, as in the days of Richard Lord Scrope, who
built the castle four hundred years ago. A considerable portion
of the edifice is still habitable; some of the rooms look
really comfortable; others are let as workshops to a tinker
and glazier, and down in the vaults you see the apparatus for
casting sheet-lead. We saw the room in which the hapless
Mary was confined, and the window by which, as is said, she
tried, but failed, to escape. We went to the top, and looked
over into the inner court; and got a bird&#x2019;s-eye view of the
village and of Bolton Park and Hall, amid the wooded landscape;
and then to the bottom, down damp stone stairs, to
what seemed the lowest vault, where, however, there was a
lower depth&mdash;the dungeon&mdash;into which we descended by a
ladder. What a dismal abode! of gloom too dense for one
feeble candle to enliven. The man who showed the way said
there was a well in one corner; but I saw nothing except
that that spot looked blacker than the rest. To think that
such a prison should have been built in the &#x201c;good old
times!&#x201d;</p>

<p>On leaving the village, an old woman gave me a touch of
the broadest dialect I had yet heard: &#x201c;Eh! is ye boun into
Swawldawl?&#x201d; she exclaimed, in reply to my inquiry. We
were going into Swaledale, and, taking a byeway above the
village of Redmire, soon came to a road leading up the dale to
Reeth, into which my friend turned, while I went on to the
northern slope of Wensleydale. You ascend by a steep,
winding road to Scarthe Nick, the pass on the summit, and
there you have a glorious prospect&mdash;many a league of hill and
hollow, of moor and meadow. From Bolton Castle and its
little dependency, which lie well under the eye, you can look
down the dale and catch sight of the ruined towers of Middleham;
Aysgarth Force reveals itself by a momentary quivering
flash; and scattered around, seven churches and eight villages,
more or less environed by woods, complete the landscape.
The scene, with its wealth of quiet beauty, is one suggestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of peace and well-being, dear to the Englishman&#x2019;s heart. To
one coming suddenly upon it from the dreary moorlands which
lie between Wensleydale and Richmond, there would be something
of enchantment in the far-spreading view.</p>

<p>I turned my back on it at last, and followed the road across
the moors, where the memory of what you have just left
becomes fairer by contrast. The route is solitary, and apparently
but little frequented, for in ten miles I met only a
man and a boy; and the monotony is only relieved after a
while by a falling away of the brown slopes on the right,
opening a view of the Hambleton Hills. There is one public-house
on the way, the <i>Halfpenny House</i>, down in a hollow, by
no means an agreeable resting-place, especially for a hungry
man with a liking for cleanliness. Not far from it is Hart-Leap
Well, sung by Wordsworth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;There&#x2019;s neither dog nor heifer, horse nor sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will wet his lips within that cup of stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oftentimes when all are fast asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This water doth send forth a dolorous groan.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By-and-by, perhaps, ere you have done thinking of the
poem, you come to the brow of a long declivity, the end of the
moors, and are rewarded by a view which rivals that seen
from Scarthe Nick. Swaledale opens before you, overspread
with waving fields of grain, with numerous farmsteads
scattered up and down, with a long range of cliff breaking
the opposite slope, and, about four miles distant, Richmond on
its lofty seat, crowned by the square castle-keep, tall and
massive. I saw it lit by the afternoon sun, and needed no
better invitation for a half-hour&#x2019;s halt on the heathery bank.</p>

<p>You descend to the wheat-fields, and see no more of the
town until close upon it. Swale, as you will notice while
crossing the bridge, still shows the characteristics of a mountain
stream, though broader and deeper than at Thwaite,
where we last parted company with it. Very steep is the
grass-grown street leading from the river up to the main part
of the town, where, having found a comfortable public-house,
I went at once to the castle. It occupies the summit of a
bluff, which, rising bold and high from the Swale, commands
a noble prospect over what Whitaker calls &#x201c;the Piedmont of
Richmondshire.&#x201d; On the side towards the river, the walls are
all broken and ruinous, with here and there a loophole or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
window opening, through which you may look abroad on the
landscape, and ponder on the changes which have befallen
since Alan the Red built a fortress here on the lands given to
him in reward for prowess by the Conqueror. It was in 1071
that he began to fortify, and portions of his masonry yet
remain, fringed with ivy and tufts of grass, and here and there
the bugloss growing from the crevices. Perhaps while you
saunter to and fro in the castle-garth the keeper will appear
and tell you&mdash;though not without leave&mdash;his story of the
ruins. If it will add to your pleasure, he will show you the
spot where George IV. sat when Prince of Wales, and
declared the prospect to be the finest he had ever beheld.
You will be told which is Robin Hood&#x2019;s Tower, which the
Gold Tower&mdash;so called because of a tradition that treasure
was once discovered therein&mdash;and which is Scolland&#x2019;s Hall,
where knights, and nobles, and high-born dames held their
banquets. And here you will be reminded of Fitzhughs and
Marmions, Randolph de Glanville, and William the Lion, of
Nevilles and Scropes, and of the Lennox&mdash;a natural son of
Charles II.&mdash;to whom the dukedom of Richmond was given
by the merry monarch, and to whose descendants it still
belongs.</p>

<p>One side of the garth is enclosed by a new building to be
used as barracks or a military depôt, and near this, at the
angle towards the town, rises the keep. What a mighty tower
it is! ninety-nine feet high, the walls eleven feet thick,
strengthened on all sides by straight buttresses, an impressive
memorial of the Normans. It was built by Earl Conan,
seventy-five years after Red Alan&#x2019;s bastions. The lowest
chamber is dark and vaulted, with the rings still remaining
to which the lamps were hung, and a floor of natural rock
pierced by the old well. The chief entrance is now on the
first floor, to which you mount by an outer stair, and the first
things you see on entering are the arms and accoutrements of
the Yorkshire militia, all carefully arranged. The view from
the top delights your eye by its variety and extent&mdash;a great
sweep of green hills and woods, the winding dale, and beyond,
the brown heights that stretch away to the mountains. You
see the town and all its picturesque features: the towers of
St. Mary&#x2019;s and of the old Gray Friars&#x2019; monastery, and Trinity
Chapel at one side of the market-place, now desecrated by an
intrusion of petty merchandise. And, following the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the river downwards, you can see in the meadows among the
woods the ruins of the Abbey of St. Agatha, at Easby. A
few miles farther, and the stream flows past Catterick, the
Cattaractonium of the Romans; and Bolton-on-Swale, the
burial-place of old Jenkins.</p>

<p>On leaving the castle, make your way down to the path
which runs round the face of the precipice below the walls,
yet high enough above the river for pleasing views: a good
place for an evening stroll. Then descend to a lower level,
and look back from the new bridge near the railway station;
you will be charmed with the singularly picturesque view of
the town, clustered all along the hill-top, and terminated by
the imposing mass of ruins and the lordly keep. And there
is something to be seen near at hand: the station, built in
Gothic style, pleasantly situate among trees; St. Martin&#x2019;s
Cell, founded more than seven hundred years ago, now sadly
dilapidated, and used as a cow-stall. Beyond, on the slope
of the hill, stands the parish church, with a fine lofty tower;
and near it are the old grammar school, famous for good
scholars; and the Tate Testimonial, a handsome Gothic
edifice, with cloisters, where the boys play in rainy weather.
It was in that churchyard that Herbert Knowles wrote the
poem</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Methinks it is good to be here,&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which has long kept his name in memory.</p>

<p>Turn into the path on the left near the bridge, follow it
through the wood which hangs on the slope above the river,
then between the meadows and gardens, and past the mill, and
you come to Easby Abbey, a charming ruin in a charming spot.
You see a gentle eminence, rich in noble trees&mdash;the &#x201c;abbot&#x2019;s
elm&#x201d; among them&mdash;with a mansion on the summit, and in
the meadow at the foot the group of ruins, not so far from the
river but that you can hear it murmuring briskly along its
stony channel. They occupy a considerable space, and the
longer you wander from kitchen to refectory, from oratory to
chapter-house, under broken arches, from one weedy heap of
masonry to another, the more will you become aware of their
picturesque beauties. The effect is heightened by magnificent
masses of ivy, and trees growing out from the gaping stones,
and about the grounds, screening and softening the ancient
walls with quivering verdure. Here, for centuries, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
burial-place of the Scropes, that powerful family who became
possessors of Easby not long after the death of Roald, constable
of Richmond, founder of the abbey in 1152. Hence
the historical associations impart a deeper interest to the loveliness
of nature and the beauty of architecture.</p>

<p>The gate-house, also mantled with ivy, stands isolated in
the meadow beyond, and Easby church between it and the
ruins. And a pretty little church it is&mdash;a very jewel. Ivy
creeps over it, and apparently through it, for a thick stem
grows out of the wall three feet from the ground. Above the
porch you may see three carved shields, time-worn memorials
of Conyers, Aske, and Scrope.</p>

<p>To linger here while the sun went down, and the shadows
darkened behind the walls, and the glory streamed through
the blank windows, was a rare enjoyment. It was dusk when
I returned to the town, and there I finished with another
stroll on the path under the castle, thinking of the ancient
legend, and wishing for a peep at the mysterious vault where
King Arthur&#x2019;s warriors lie asleep. Long, long ago, a man,
while wandering about the hill, was conducted into an underground
vault by a mysterious personage, and there he saw to
his amazement a great multitude lying in deep slumber. Ere
he recovered, his guide placed in his hands a horn and a
sword; he drew the blade half out of the sheath, when lo!
every sleeper stirred as if about to awake, and the poor mortal,
terror-stricken, loosed his hold, the sword slid back, and the
opportunity of release was lost, to recur no more for many a
long day. The unlucky wight heard as he crept forth a
bitter voice crying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Potter, Potter Thompson!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou had either drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword or blown that horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou&#x2019;d been the luckiest man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever was born.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By nine o&#x2019;clock the next morning I was in Ripon, having
been obliged to content myself with a glimpse of Northallerton
from the railway; and to forego a ramble to the
Standard Hill. I was soon on the top of the minster tower
looking abroad on the course of the Ure, no longer a dale, as
where we last saw it, but a broad vale teeming with corn, and
adorned with woods, conspicuous among which are the broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
forest-like masses of Studley Royal&mdash;the site of Fountains
Abbey. Norton Conyers, the seat of the Nortons, whose
names figure in Wordsworth&#x2019;s poem, lies a few miles up the
stream; and a few miles in the other direction are Boroughbridge
and Aldborough, once important British and Roman
stations. There the base Cartismandua, betrayer of Caractacus,
held her court? there the vast rude camp of the legions grew
into a sumptuous city; and there was fought one of the
battles of the Roses, fatal to Lancaster; and there for years
was a stronghold of the boroughmongers. The horizon no
longer shows a ring of bleak moorlands, but green swells and
wood all round to the east, where the hills of Cleveland
terminate the view.</p>

<p>Then, while sauntering on the floor of the stately edifice
we may remember that in 661 the King of Northumbria gave
a piece of land here to one of his abbots for the foundation
of a religious house: that Wilfrid, the learned bishop,
replaced the first modest structure by a magnificent monastery,
which the heathen Danes burnt and wasted in 860; but
Wilfrid, who was presently created Archbishop of York, soon
rebuilt his church, surpassing the former in magnificence,
and by his learning and resolute assertion of his rights won,
for himself great honour, and a festival day in the calendar.
The anniversary of his return from Rome whither he went
to claim his privileges, is still celebrated in Ripon, by a
procession as little accordant with modern notions as that
which perpetuates Peeping Tom&#x2019;s infamous memory at
Coventry. The present edifice was built by Roger of Bishopbridge,
Archbishop of York in the twelfth century, and
renowned for his munificence; but the variations of style&mdash;two
characters of Norman, and Perpendicular, and a medley in
the window, still show how much of the oldest edifice was
incorporated with the new, and the alterations at different
times.</p>

<p>The crypt is believed to be a portion of the church built by
Wilfrid; to reach it you must pass through narrow, darksome
passages, and when there, the guide will not fail to show you
the hole known as Wilfrid&#x2019;s needle&mdash;a needle of properties as
marvellous as the garment offered to the ladies of King
Arthur&#x2019;s court&mdash;for no unchaste maiden can pass through the
eye. The bone-house and a vault, walled and paved with
human bones, still exists; and the guide, availing himself of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
a few extraordinary specimens, still delivers his lecture surrounded
by ghastly accompaniments.</p>

<p>Without seeing the minster, you would guess Ripon to be
a cathedral town; it has the quiet, respectable air which
befits the superiorities of the church. The market cross is
a tall obelisk, and if you happen to be near it at nine in the
evening, you will, perhaps, think of the sonorous custom at
Bainbridge, for one of the constables blows three blasts on
the horn every night at the mayor&#x2019;s door, and three more
by the market cross. And so the days of Victoria witness
a custom said to have been begun in the days of Alfred.
The horn is an important instrument in Ripon; it was
brought out and worn on feasts and ceremonial days by the
&#x201c;wakeman,&#x201d; or a serjeant; certain of the mayors have taken
pride in beautifying it, and supplying a new belt, and the
town arms show a golden horn and black belt ornamented
with silver.</p>

<p>At Beverley there are few signs of visitors; here, many,
attracted by Fountains Abbey. Carriage after carriage laden
with sight-seers rattled past as I walked to Studley, a distance
of nearly three miles. Even at the toll-bar on the way you
can buy guide-books, as well as ginger-beer. Beyond the
gate you may leave the road for a field-path, which crosses
the street of Studley, and brings you to a short cut through
the park. Soon we come to the magnificent beechen avenue,
and standing at the upper end we see a long green walk, with
the minster in the distance, and beyond that the dark wold.
Then by another avenue on the left we approach the lake and
the lodge, where you enter your name in a book, pay a shilling,
and are handed over, with the party that happens to be waiting,
to the care of a guide. He leads you along broad gravelled
paths, between slopes of smooth green turf, flower-beds,
shrubberies, rock work, and plantations, to vistas terminated
by statues, temples, and lakes filled with coffee-coloured water.
To me, the trees seemed more beautiful than anything else;
and fancy architecture looked poor by the side of tall beeches,
larches, and magnificent Norway pines. And I could not
help wishing that Earl de Grey, to whom the estate belongs,
would abolish the puerile theatrical trick called <i>The Surprise</i>.
Arrived on the brow of an eminence, which overlooks the
valley of the little river Skell, you are required to stand two
or three yards in the rear of a wooden screen. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
guide, with a few words purporting, &#x201c;Now, you shall see
what you shall see,&#x201d; throws open the doors of the screen, and
Fountains Abbey appears in the hollow below. As if the
view of such a ruin could be improved by artifice!</p>

<p>Then a descent to Robin Hood&#x2019;s Well&mdash;a spring of delicious
water, which you will hardly pass without quaffing a draught
to the memory of the merry outlaw. And now we are near
the ruin, and, favoured by the elevation of the path, can
overlook at once all the ground plan, the abbot&#x2019;s quarters&mdash;under
which the Skell flows through an arched channel&mdash;the
dormitory, the refectory, the lofty arches of the church, and
the noble tower rising to a height of one hundred and sixty-six
feet.</p>

<p>We were admiring the great extent and picturesque effects
of the ruins, when a harsh whistle among the trees on the
left struck up <i>Pop goes the Weasel</i>; singularly discordant in
such a place. I could not help saying that the whistler
deserved banishment, to the edge of the park at least&mdash;when
the guide answered, &#x201c;Yes, but he blows the whistle with his
nose.&#x201d; If Earl de Grey would abolish that nosing of a vulgar
melody, as well as <i>The Surprise</i>, many a visitor would feel
grateful.</p>

<p>Presently we cross the bridge, and there are the yew-trees,
one of which sheltered the pious monks, who, scandalized by
the lax discipline of the brethren in the Benedictine Abbey of
St. Mary&#x2019;s, at York, separated from them, migrated hither in
December, 1132, and lived for some months, enduring great
privations, with no other roof but the trees. Skelldale was
then a wild and desolate spot; but the Cistercians persevered;
Thurstan befriended them, and in course of years one of the
grandest monastic piles that England could boast arose in the
meadow bordering the narrow stream. Its roll of abbots
numbers thirty-nine names, some of high distinction, whose
tombs may yet be seen.</p>

<p>After taking you aside to look at Fountains Hall, a Tudor
mansion, the guide leads the way to the cloisters, and, unlocking
a door, admits you to the interior of the ruins. The view
of the nave, with its Norman pillars and arches extending for
nearly two hundred feet, is remarkably imposing; and as you
pace slowly over the soft green carpet into the transept, thence
to the choir and Lady chapel, each more beautiful than the
last, you experience unwonted emotions of delight and sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>prise.
Once within the Lady chapel, you will hardly care to
leave it for any other portion of the ruins, until the door is
unlocked for departure.</p>

<p>The return route is on the opposite side of the valley to
that by which you approach. From a hollow in the cliff, a
little way on, you may, on turning to take a last look of the
ruins, waken a clearly articulate echo; but, alas! the lurking
voice is made to utter overmuch nonsense. What would the
devout monks say could they hear it? However, if history
is to be depended on, even they were not perfect; for towards
the close of their career, they fell into evil ways, and became
a reproach. As we read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;In summer time, when leaves grow green,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And flowers are fresh and gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robin Hood and his merry men<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were disposed to play.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And when Robin, overjoyed at Little John&#x2019;s skill, exclaims
that he would ride a hundred miles to find one to match him,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;That caused Will Scadlocke to laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He laught full heartily:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lives a curtall fryer in Fountaines Abbey<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will beate both him and thee.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A right sturdy friar, who with his fifty dogs kept Robin and
his fifty men at bay, until Little John&#x2019;s shooting brought him
to terms:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;This curtall fryer had kept Fountaines dale<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seven long yeares and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was neither knight, lord, nor earle<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Could make him yeeld before.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of old Jenkins, it is recorded that he was once steward to
Lord Conyers, who used to send him at times with a message
to the Abbot of Fountains Abbey; and that the abbot always
gave him, &#x201c;besides wassel, a quarter of a yard of roast beef
for his dinner, and a great black jack of strong beer.&#x201d; The
Abbot of Fountains was one of three Yorkshire abbots beheaded
on Tower-hill for their share in the <i>Pilgrimage of
Grace</i>.</p>

<p>Judging from the one to whom we were allotted, the
guides are civil, and not uninformed as to the traditions and
history of Studley Royal and its neighbourhood. They are
instructed not to lose sight of their party, and to conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
them only by the prescribed paths. So there is no opportunity
for wandering at will, or a leisurely meditation among
the ruins.</p>

<p>I walked back to the railway-station at Ripon, and journeyed
thence to Thirsk, where a pleasant stroll finished the
evening. Of the castle of the Mowbrays&mdash;the rendezvous
of the English troops when marching to the Battle of the
Standard&mdash;the site alone remains on the south-west of the
town. The chantry, founded by one of the Mowbrays in
Old Thirsk, has also disappeared. And the great tree that
stood on the green in the same suburb has gone too. It was
under the tree on Thirsk green, and not at Topcliffe, as some
say, that the fourth Earl Percy was massacred; certain it is,
that the elections of members to serve in Parliament were
held under the wide-spreading branches even from the earliest
times. It was burnt down in 1818 by a party of boys who
lit a fire in the hollow trunk. But the ugly old shambles had
not disappeared from the market-place: their destruction,
however, so said the bookseller, was imminent.</p>

<p>The church, dating from the fifteenth century, has recently
been restored, and well repays an examination. Among the
epitaphs on the tombstones, I noticed a variation of the old
familiar strain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Afflictions sore he long time bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which wore his strength away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made him long for heavenly rest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which never will decay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And another, a curiosity in its way:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Corruption, Earth, and worms,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall but refine this flesh,<br /></span>

<p>The morning dawns with promise of a glorious day, and of
glad enjoyment for us in our coming walk. Our route will
lead us through a rich and fertile region to the Hambleton
Hills&mdash;the range which within the past two weeks has so
often terminated our view with its long blue elevations. We
shall see another ruin&mdash;Rievaulx Abbey, and another old
castle at Helmsley&mdash;and if all go well, shall sleep at night
within the walls of York.</p>

<p>A few miles on the way and we come to Sutton, a pretty
village, where nearly every house has its front garden bright
with flowers, with tall proud lilies here and there, and standard
roses. And every lintel and door-sill is decorated with
yellow ochre, and a border of whitewash enlivens even the
humblest window. And the inside of the cottages is as clean
as the outside, and some have the front room papered. It
is truly an English village, for no other country can show the
like.</p>

<p>Now the hills stand up grandly before us, showing here
and there a scar above the thick woods that clothe their base.
The road rises across the broken ground: we come to a lane
on the left, marked by a limekiln, and following it upwards
between ferny banks and tangled hedges, haunted by the
thrush, we arrive presently at Gormire Lake, a pretty sheet
of water, reposing in a hollow at the foot of Whitstoncliffe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
It is best seen from the bold green bank at the upper end, for
there you face the cliff and the hill which rises behind it,
covered with copse and bracken. The lake is considerably
above the base of the hill, and appears to have been formed
by a landslip; it is tenanted by fish, and has, as I heard subsequently
at York, a subterranean outlet somewhere among
the fallen fragments at the foot of the cliff.</p>

<p>Returned to the road, we have now to ascend sharp alpine
zigzags, for the western face of Hambleton is precipitous; and
within a short distance the road makes a rise of eight hundred
feet. The increasing ascent and change of direction opens a
series of pleasing views, and as you look now this way, now
that, along the diversified flanks of the hills, you will wish for
more time to wander through such beautiful scenery. All
that comparatively level country below was once covered by a
sea, to which the hills we now stand on opposed a magnificent
shore-line of cliffs; some of their summits more than a
thousand feet in height.</p>

<p>Great is the contrast when you arrive on the brow: greenness
and fertility suddenly give place to a bleak table-land,
where the few patches of cultivation appear but meagre amid
acres of brown ling. We have taken a great step upwards
into a shrewish region. That white patch seen afar is a hunting
and training colony, and there go two grooms riding, followed
by a pack of hounds. What a chilly-looking place! A back
settlement in Michigan could hardly be more lonely. The
boys may well betake themselves for amusement to the education
of dogs. Was it here, I wonder, that the Yorkshire boy
lived who had a bull pup, in the training of which he took
great delight? One day, seeing his father come into the yard,
the youngster said, &#x201c;Father, you go down on your hands and
knees and blare like a bull, and see what our pup&#x2019;ll do.&#x201d; The
parent complied; but while he was doing his best to roar like
a bull, the dog flew at him and seized him by the lip. Now
the man roared in earnest, and tried to shake off his tormentor,
while the boy, dancing in ecstacy, cried, &#x201c;Bear it, father!
bear it! It&#x2019;ll be the makin&#x2019; o&#x2019; t&#x2019; pup.&#x201d;</p>

<p>By-and-by comes a descent, and the road drops suddenly
into a deep glen, crowded with luxuriant woods. Many a
lovely view do we get here, as the windings of the road bring
us to wider openings and broader slopes of foliage. We pass
the hamlet of Skawton; a brook becomes our companion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
woods still shut us in when we cross the Rye, a shallow,
lively stream, and get a view from the bridge up Ryedale.</p>

<p>A short distance up the stream brings us to the little village
of Rivas&mdash;as the country folk call it&mdash;and to Rievaulx Abbey.
The civil old woman who shows the way into the ruin, will
tell you that Lord Feversham does not like to see visitors get
over the fence; and then, stay as long as you will, she leaves
you undisturbed. What a pleasure awaits you!&mdash;a charm
which Bolton and Fountains failed alike to inspire: perhaps
because of the narrowness of the dale, and the feeling of deep
seclusion imparted by the high thickly wooded hills on each
side, the freedom allowed to vegetation in and around the
place, and to your own movements. The style is Early English,
and while surveying the massive clustered columns that
once supported the tower, the double rows of arches, and the
graceful windows now draped with ivy of the nave, you will
restore the light and beautiful architecture in imagination, and
not without a wish that Time would retrace his flight just for
one hour, and show you the abbey in all its primitive beauty,
when Ryedale was &#x201c;a place of vast solitude and horror,&#x201d; as
the old chronicler says.</p>

<p>Walter L&#x2019;Espec, Lord of the Honour of Helmsley, a baron
of high renown in his day, grieving with his wife, the Lady
Adeline, over the death of their only son by a fall from a
horse, built a priory at Kirkham, the scene of the accident,
and in 1131 founded here an abbey for Cistercian monks.
And here after some years, during which he distinguished
himself at the Battle of the Standard, he took the monastic
vows, and gave himself up to devout study and contemplation
until his death in 1153. And then he was buried in the
glorious edifice which he had raised to the service of God,
little dreaming that in later days when, fortress and church
would be alike in ruins, other men would come with different
thoughts, though perhaps not purer aims, and muse within
the walls where he had often knelt in prayer, and admire his
work, and respect his memory.</p>

<p>Much remains to delight the eye; flying buttresses, clerestory
windows, corbels, capitals, and mouldings, some half
buried in the rank grass and nettles. And how the clustering
masses of ivy heighten the beauty! One of the stems, that
seems to lend strength to the great column against which it
leans, is more than three feet in circumference, and bears aloft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
a glorious green drapery. An elder grows within the nave,
contributing its fair white blossoms to the fulness of beauty.
The refectory, too, is half buried with ivy, and there you
walk on what was once the floor of the crypt, and see the remains
of the groins that supported the floor above: and there
at one side is the recess where one of the monks used to read
aloud some holy book while the others sat at dinner. Adjoining
the refectory is a paddock enclosed by ash-trees, which
appears to have been the cloister court. Now the leaves rustle
overhead, and birds chirrup in the branches, and swallows flit
in and out, and through the openings once filled by glass that
rivalled the rainbow in colour.</p>

<p>For two hours did I wander and muse; now sitting in the
most retired nook, now retreating to a little distance to find
out the best points of view. And my first impression strengthened;
and I still feel that of all the abbeys Rievaulx is the
one I should like to see again. But the day wore on, and
warned me, though reluctant, to depart.</p>

<p>A small fee to the quiet old woman makes her thankful, and
prompts her to go and point out the path by which you mount
zigzagging through the thick wood to the great terrace near
the summit of the hill. It will surprise you to see a natural
terrace smooth and green as a lawn, of considerable width, and
half a mile in length; that is, the visible extent, for it stretches
farther round the heights towards Helmsley. At one end
stands a pavilion, decorated in the interior with paintings, at
the other a domed temple, and from all the level between you
get a glorious prospect up Ryedale&mdash;up the dale by which we
came from Thirsk, and over leagues of finely-wooded hills, to
a rim of swarthy moorland. And beneath, as in a nest, the
ancient ruin and the little village repose in the sunshine, and
the rapid river twinkles with frequent curves through the
meadows.</p>

<p>The gardener who lives in the basement of the pavilion will
show you the paintings and a small pamphlet, in which the
subjects are described; and perhaps tell you that the family
used to come over at times from Duncombe Park and dine in
the ornamented chamber. He will request you, moreover, to
be careful to shut the gate by which you leave the terrace at
a break in the shrubbery.</p>

<p>The road is at the edge of the next field, and leads us in
about an hour to Helmsley, a quiet rural town very pleasantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
situated beneath broad slopes of wood. It has a good church,
a few quaint old houses, some still covered with thatch, a
brook running along the street, a market cross, and a relic of
the castle built by De Roos, when Yorkshire still wept the
Conquest.</p>

<p>It had surprised me while on the way from Thirsk to find
more difficulty in understanding the rustic dialect than in the
remoter parts of the north and west. The same peculiarities
prevail here in the town; and the landlord&#x2019;s daughter, who
waited on me at the house where I dined, professed a difficulty
in understanding me. My question about the omnibus
for Gilling completely puzzled her for a few minutes, until
light dawned on her, and she exclaimed joyfully, &#x201c;Oh! ye
mean t&#x2019; boos!&#x201d;</p>

<p>A few miles east of Helmsley is Kirkby Moorside, where the
proud Duke of Buckingham died, though not &#x201c;in the worst
inn&#x2019;s worst room;&#x201d; and near it is Kirkdale, with its antiquated
church, and the famous cave in which the discovery of
the bones of wild animals some thirty years ago established a
new epoch for geologists. From Kirkby you can look across to
the hilly moors behind Whitby; and if you incline to explore
farther, Castle Howard will repay a visit, and you may go
and look into the gorge through which the Derwent flows, at
Malton, keeping in mind what geologists tell us, that if the
gorge should happen to be closed by any convulsion, the Vale
of Pickering would again become a sea.</p>

<p>Of Helmsley Castle the remains are but fragmentary; a
portion of the lofty keep stands on an eminence, around which
you may still trace the hollows once filled by the triple moat.
The gateway is comparatively sound, the barbican is sadly
dilapidated; and within other parts of the old walls which
have been repaired, Lord Feversham&#x2019;s tenants assemble once
a year to pay their rents. The ruin is so pleasantly embowered
by trees and ivy, so agreeable for a lounge on a July
day, that I regretted being summoned away too soon by &#x201c;t&#x2019;
boos&#x201d; driver&#x2019;s horn. There was no time for a look at Feversham
House, about half a mile distant, nor for a few miles&#x2019;
walk to Byland Abbey&mdash;another Cistercian edifice&mdash;founded in
1143 by Roger de Mowbray. I could only glance at the
skirts of the park, where preparations were making for a
flower-show, and at the shield on the front of the lodge,
bearing the motto, <i>Deo, Regi, Patriæ</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rye here is a smaller stream than at Rievaulx, owing
to the loss of water by the &#x2018;swallows&#x2019; in Duncombe Park;
half a mile lower down it reappears in full current. But the
driver is impatient; we shall be too late for the train at Gilling,
and the steep Howardian Hills are to be crossed on the
way. Fine views open over the woods; then we leave the
trees for a while; a vast prospect appears of the Vale of York,
and at Oswaldkirk&mdash;a picturesque village&mdash;the road falling
rapidly brings us once more into a wooded region, and in due
time we come to Gilling, on the branch railway to Malton.</p>

<p>There was not time, or I would have run up the hill behind
the station to look at the noble avenue of beeches that forms a
worthy approach to Fairfax Hall&mdash;the home of a family venerated
by all who love liberty. I felt an emotion of regret
when the station-clerk told me that the present Fairfax is an
aged man and childless; for ere long the name will disappear,
and the estate become a possession of the Cholmleys.</p>

<p>The train arrives; five miles on it stops at Coxwold, where
Sterne passed seven years of his life; then two leagues more,
and we have to wait ninety minutes for a train down from
the north, at Pilmoor junction&mdash;a singularly unattractive spot.
Luckily I had a book in my knapsack, and so beguiled the
time till the bell rang that summoned us to York.</p>

<p>In my wanderings I have sometimes had the curiosity to
try a <i>Temperance Hotel</i>, and always repented it, because experience
showed that temperance meant poor diet, stingy
appliances, and slovenly accommodations. So it was not without
misgivings that I resolved to make one more experiment,
and see what temperance meant in the metropolis of Yorkshire.
The <i>Hotel</i>, which did not displease me, looks into Micklegate,
not far from the Bar on which the heads of dukes and nobles
were impaled, as mentioned in the <i>Lay of Towton Field</i>.</p>

<p>Considering how many quartos have been filled with the
history and description of York, into how many little books
the big books have been condensed, every traveller is supposed
to know as much as he desires concerning the ancient
city, ere he visits it. For one who has but a day to spare,
the best way of proceeding is of course to get on the top of
the minster tower, and stay there until his memory is refreshed
by the sight of what he sees below. At a height of
two hundred feet above the pavement you can overlook the
great cluster of clean red roofs, and single out the twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
churches that yet remain of the fifty once visible from this
same elevation. Clifford&#x2019;s Tower, a portion of the old castle,
stands now within the precincts of the gaol; the line of the
city walls can be seen, and the situation of the four Bars;
there, by the river, is the Guildhall where King Charles was
purchased from the Scots; there the small river Foss, that
rises in the Howardian Hills, and once filled the Roman
ditches, joins the Ouse. Outside the walls, Severus Hill
marks the spot where the emperor, who died here in 210, was
burnt on his funeral pile with all the honours due to a wearer
of the purple; another hill shows where Scrope was beheaded.
To the south lies Bishopthorpe, the birthplace of Guy
Fawkes, and residence of the bishops. Eastward is Stamford
Brig, where the hard Norwegian king, flushed with
victory, lost the battle and his life&mdash;where the spoil in gold
ornaments was so great, &#x201c;that twelve young men could hardly
carry it upon their shoulders&#x201d;&mdash;whence the victor Harold
marched to lose in turn life and crown at Hastings. On the
west lies Marston Moor, and farther to the south-west the
field of Towton. And then, from wandering afar over the
broad vale, your eye returns to the minster itself, and looks
down on all its properties, and comfortable residences, snug
gardens, and plots of greenest turf, all covering ground on
which the Romans built their camp, and where they erected
a temple for the worship of heathen deities.</p>

<p>As regards the interior, whatever may have been your
emotions of admiration or wonder in other cathedrals, they
become fuller and deeper in this of York. After two long
visits, I still wished for more time to pace again the lofty
aisles, to hear the organ&#x2019;s rolling notes, while marvelling at
the glory of architecture.</p>

<p>In Roger North&#x2019;s time, as he relates, the interior of the
cathedral was the favourite resort of fashionable strollers: in
an earlier time, when archery was practised keenly as rifle-shooting
in our day, and the prophecy as to the pre-eminence
of York was not yet forgotten, a ballad was written in praise
of the city: thus</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;The Maior of Yorke, with his companie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all in the fieldes, I warrant ye,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">As if it had been at London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">For mery pastime &amp; companie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Except the cittie of London.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From the minster walk as far as may be along the city
walls: you will see the four Bars&mdash;Monk, Micklegate, Walmgate,
and Bootham; the first-named still retaining the barbican.
In some of the narrow lanes near the water-side you
may discover old mansions, the residences of the magnates of
York two hundred years ago, now tenanted by numbers of
working-people, and grand staircases and panelled rooms,
looking dingy and squalid. Then go forth and take a turn
under the trees of the New Walk on the bank of the Ouse,
and see a much-frequented resort of the citizens, who certainly
cannot boast that their environs are romantic. You
would hardly believe that the stream flowing so placidly by
embosoms the rapid rivers we crossed so often while in the
mountains. If legends deceive not, any one who came and
threw five white pebbles into a certain part of the Ouse as
the hour of one struck on the first morning of May, would
then see everything he desired to see, past, present, and to
come, on the surface of the water. Once a knight returning
from the wars desired to see how it fared with his lady-love:
he threw in the pebbles, and beheld the home of the maiden,
a mansion near Scarborough, and a youth wearing a mask
and cloak descending from her window, and the hiding of
the ladder by the serving-man. Maddened by jealousy, he
mounted and rode with speed; his horse dropped dead in
sight of the house; he saw the same youth ascending the
ladder, rushed forward, and stabbed him to the heart. It
was his betrothed. She was not faithless; still loved her
knight, and had only been to a masquerade. For many a day
thereafter did the knight&#x2019;s anguish and remorse appear as the
punishment of unlawful curiosity in the minstrel&#x2019;s lay and
gestour&#x2019;s romance.</p>

<p>Return, and take a walk in that pleasant ground, half park,
half garden, which we saw from the tower, and see how
enviable a site has fallen to the Yorkshire Philosophical
Society for their museum. To have such a scope of smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
green turf, flower-beds, shrubs, and trees in the heart of a
city, as the shelter of remarkable antiquities and scientific
collections, is a rare privilege. At one side stand the remains
of St. Leonard&#x2019;s Hospital&mdash;Norman and early English&mdash;sheltering,
when I saw it, something far, far more ancient
than itself&mdash;a huge fossil saurian. The ruins of St. Mary&#x2019;s
Abbey appear on the other side; and between the two the
Doric edifice, containing the museum, library, and offices of
the Society. In another part of the grounds, the Hospitium of
the monks, which in a country village would pass for a
mediæval barn, now contains the admirable collection of
Roman and British antiquities for which York is celebrated.
Seeing the numerous tiles stamped with Latin words and
numerals, the tombs and altars, the household utensils, and
personal ornaments, your idea of the Roman occupation will,
perhaps, become more vivid than before; and again, while
you examine the fragment of the wall and tower, supposed to
have been built by Hadrian, strong and solid even after the
lapse of nineteen centuries. And when you look once more
at the Abbey and the Hospital, you will regret the ravages of
plunderers. For years the ruins were worked as a quarry by all
who wanted stone for building purposes, and, as if to accelerate
the waste, great heaps were burnt in a limekiln erected
on the spot; and it is said that stone pillaged from St. Mary&#x2019;s
at York was used for the repair of Beverley minster.</p>

<p>However, the spirit of preservation has prevented further
dilapidation, and old Time himself is constrained to do his
wasting imperceptibly. St. Mary&#x2019;s Lodge, adjoining the
abbey, long neglected, and degraded into a pothouse, was
restored some years ago, and occupied as a residence by
Professor Phillips, whose connexion with the Society will not
soon be forgotten. A charming residence it is; and an evening
and a morning spent within it, enable me to affirm that
its chambers, though clothed in a modern dress, witness hospitality
as generous as that of the monks of the olden time.</p>

the Aire&mdash;To Keighley.</p>

<p>On the second morning of my stay in York, after a farewell
visit to the minster, I travelled by rail to Leeds. I had little
time, and, remembering former days, less inclination to tarry
in this great, dismal, cloth-weaving town; so after a passing
glance at the new town-hall, and some other improvements, I
walked through the long, scraggy suburb such as only a busy
manufacturing town can create, to Kirkstall Abbey. This
also was an abode of the Cistercians, founded in 1152 by
Henry de Lacy; and they who can discourse learnedly on
such subjects pronounce it to be, as a ruin, more perfect than
some which we have already visited. But it stands only a
few yards from a black, much-frequented road, and within
sight and hearing of a big forge, and the Aire flows past, not
pellucid, but stained with the refuse liquor of dye-works.
Still the site is not devoid of natural beauty; and an hour
may be agreeably passed in sauntering about the ruin. It
must have been a delightful haunt when Leeds was Loidis in
Elmete.</p>

<p>I had expected to see the valley of the Aire sprinkled with
the villa residences of the merchants of Leeds; but the busy
traders prefer to live in the town, and in all the nine miles on
the way to Bradford, you have only a succession of factories,
dye-works, and excavations, encroaching on and deforming
the beauty of the valley, while the vegetation betrays signs of
the harmful effect of smoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>As the afternoon drew on, I bethought myself that it was
the last day of the week, and a desire came over me for one
more quiet Sunday among the hills. So I turned aside to
Newlay station, and took flight by the first train that came
up for Settle, retracing part of my journey through Craven of
the week before.</p>

<p>On the way from the station to the town, I made a détour
to Giggleswick, a village that claims notice for its grammar-school,
a fine cliff&mdash;part of the Craven fault&mdash;and a remarkable
spring. Of his visit to this place Drunken Barnaby
chants:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Thence to Giggleswick most steril,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hem&#x2019;d with shelves and rocks of peril,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near to th&#x2019; way, as a traveller goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fine fresh spring both ebbs and flows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither know the learn&#x2019;d that travel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What procures it, salt or gravel.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Drayton helps us to a legend which accounts for the origin
of the spring. Suppose we pause for a few minutes to read it.
Coming to this place, he says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;At Giggleswick where I a fountain can you show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That eight times in a day is said to ebb and flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sometime was a nymph, and in the mountains high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Craven, whose blue heads for caps put on the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst th&#x2019; Oreads there, and sylvans made abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(It was ere human foot upon those hills had trod),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the mountain kind and since she was most fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a satyr&#x2019;s chance to see her silver hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flow loosely at her back, as up a cliff she clame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beauties noting well, her features, and her frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after her he goes; which when she did espy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him like the wind the nimble nymph doth fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hurry down the rocks, o&#x2019;er hill and dale they drive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take her he doth strain, t&#x2019; outstrip him she doth strive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one his kind that knew, and greatly fear&#x2019;d his rape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the topick gods by praying to escape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They turn&#x2019;d her to a spring, which as she then did pant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When wearied with her course, her breath grew wondrous scant:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as the fearful nymph, then thick and short did blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now made by them a spring, so doth she ebb and flow.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was supper-time when I came to the <i>Lion</i> at Settle.
A commercial traveller, who was in the town on his first visit,
looked up from his accounts while I sat at table to tell me of
a strange word which he had heard during the day, and with
as much astonishment as if it had been Esquimaux. Indeed,
he had not recovered from his astonishment, and could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
help having a good laugh when he thought of the cause.
Seeing a factory on the outskirts of the town, he asked a girl,
&#x201c;What do they make in that factory?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;What do they addle?&#x201d; replied the girl, inquiringly. And
ever since he had been repeating to himself, &#x201c;What do they
addle?&#x201d; and always with a fresh burst of laughter.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Pretty outlandish talk that, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he said, as he
finished his story.</p>

<p>Settle is a quiet little town, built at the foot of Castleber,
another of the grand cliffs of Craven. To the inhabitants the
huge rock is a recreative resort: seats are placed at its base;
a zigzag path leads to the summit, whence the views over the
valley of the Ribble are very picturesque and pleasing. On
the north-west the broad top of Ingleborough is seen peeping
over an intervening height; Penyghent appears in the north;
and southerly, Pendle Hill rises within the borders of Lancashire.
Very beautiful did the dewy landscape seem to me the
next morning as I sat on the cliff top while the sunlight
increased upon the green expanse.</p>

<p>&#x201c;As we travelled,&#x201d; says George Fox in his <i>Journal</i>, &#x201c;we
came near a very great hill, called Pendle Hill, and I was
moved of the Lord to go up to the top of it; which I did with
difficulty, it was so very steep and high. When I was come
to the top, I saw the sea bordering upon Lancashire. From the
top of this hill the Lord let me see in what places he had a
great people to be gathered. As I went down, I found a
spring of water in the side of the hill, with which I refreshed
myself, having eaten or drunk but little for several days
before.&#x201d; The spring is still there, and known in the neighbourhood
as George Fox&#x2019;s Well.</p>

<p>After breakfast I set out to walk to Malham, about seven
miles distant, and was mounting the hill at an easy pace behind
the town, when two men came up, and presently told me
they also were going to Maum&mdash;as they pronounced it. So we
joined company, all alike strangers to the road, and came soon
to the bye-path of which the ostler at the <i>Lion</i> had advised
me: &#x201c;It would save a mile or more if I could only find the
way.&#x201d; A greater attraction for me was, that it led across the
silent pastures on the top of the hills. As I got over the stile,
an old man who was passing strongly urged us to keep the
road; we should be sure to lose ourselves, and happen never
to get to Maum at all. To which I replied, that if a Londoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and two Yorkshiremen could not find their way across six
miles of hill-country they deserved to lose it; and away we
went across the field. Ere long we were on breezy slopes,
which, opening here and there on the left, revealed curious
rocky summits beyond, and as we trod the springy turf, my
companions told me they had come by rail from Bentham, and
were going to Malham for no other purpose than to see a horse
which one of them had sent there &#x201c;to grass&#x201d; a few weeks
previously. They were as much amused at my admiration of
the scenery as I was at their taking so long a journey to look
at a quadruped. They would not go out of their way to see
Malham Cove, or Gordale Scar, not they: a horse was worth
more than all the scenery. And yet, judging by their dress
and general conversation, they were men in respectable circumstances.
Presently, as we passed a rocky cone springing
all yellow and gray from a bright green eminence, I stopped
and tried to make them understand why it was admirable,
pointing out its form, the contrasts of colour, and its relation to
surrounding objects: &#x201c;Well!&#x201d; said one, &#x201c;I never thought of
that. It do make a difference when you look at it in that way.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Neither of them had ever been to London, and what pleased
them most was to hear something about the great city. They
were as full of wonder, and as ready to express it, as children;
and not one of us found the way wearisome. We had taken
a new departure when in sight of Stockdale, a solitary farm-house
down in a hollow, as instructed, and gained a rougher
elevation, when the track, which had become faint, disappeared
altogether, and at a spot where no landmark was in
sight to guide us. &#x201c;The old man was right,&#x201d; said the Yorkshiremen;
&#x201c;we have lost the way;&#x201d; and they began a debate
as to the course now to be followed. At length one strode off
in a direction that would have taken him in time to the top of
Penyghent. I looked at the sun, and declared for the east.
But no, the other remained resolute in his opinion, and would
not be persuaded. &#x201c;Let him go,&#x201d; I said to his companion,
who sided with me; &#x201c;little wit in the head makes muckle
work for the heels;&#x201d; and we took a course to the east.</p>

<p>After a while the other repented, and came panting after
us; and before we had gone half a mile we saw Malham Tarn,
broad and blue, at a distance on the left; then the track reappeared;
then Malham came in sight, lying far down in a
pleasant valley; and then we came into a rough, narrow road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
descending steeply, and the Yorkshireman acknowledged his
error.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Eh! that&#x2019;s Maum Cove, is it?&#x201d; he said, as a turn in the
road showed us the head of the valley; &#x201c;that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve
heard so much talk about. Well, it&#x2019;s a grand scar.&#x201d; He
seemed to repent of even this morsel of admiration, and helped
his neighbour with strong resolutions not to turn aside and
look up at the cliff from its base.</p>

<p>We each had a glass of ale at the public-house in the village.
Before I was aware, one of my companions paid for the three,
nor would he on any terms be persuaded otherwise.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Hoot, lad,&#x201d; he rejoined, &#x201c;say nought about it. I&#x2019;d pay
ten times as much for the pleasure of your talk.&#x201d; And with
that he silenced me.</p>

<p>Although Gordale Scar is not more than a mile from
Malham, they refused to go and see it. However, when we
came to the grazier&#x2019;s house, and they heard that the Scar lay
in the way to the pasture where the horse was turned out,
they thought they wouldn&#x2019;t mind taking a look just, as they
went. The good wife brought out bread, cheese, butter, and
a jug of beer, and would have me sit down and partake with
the others; regarding my plea that I was a stranger, and had
just taken a drink, as worthless. A few minutes sufficed, and
then her son accompanied us, for without him the horse would
never be found. We followed a road running along the base
of the precipitous hills which cross the head of the valley, to
a rustic tenement, dignified with the name of Gordale House;
and there turned towards the cliffs by the side of a brook. At
first there is nothing to indicate your approach to anything
extraordinary: you enter a great chasm, where the crags rise
high and singularly rugged, sprinkled here and there with a
small fir or graceful ash, where the bright green turf, sloping
up into all the ins and outs of the dark gray cliff, and the
little brook babbling out towards the sunshine, between great
masses of rock fallen from above, enliven the otherwise gloomy
scene. You might fancy yourself in a great roofless cave; but,
ascending to the rear, you find an outlet, a sudden bend in the
chasm, narrower, and more rocky and gloomy than the entrance.
The cliffs rise higher and overhang fearfully above,
appearing to meet indeed at the upper end; and there, from
that grim crevice, rushes a waterfall. The water makes a
bound, strikes the top of a rock, and, rushing down on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
side, forms an inverted /\ of splash and foam. And now you
feel that Gordale Scar deserves all the admiration lavished
upon it.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Well!&#x201d; exclaimed one of the Yorkshiremen, &#x201c;who&#x2019;d ha&#x2019;
thought to see anything like this? And we living all our life
within twenty mile of it! &#x2019;Tis a wonderful place.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;So, you do believe at last,&#x201d; I rejoined, &#x201c;that scenery is
worth looking at, as well as a horse?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;That I do. I don&#x2019;t wonder now that you come all the
way from London to see our hills.&#x201d;</p>

<p>We crossed the fall, climbed up the rock into another bend
of the chasm, where the water makes its first plunge, unseen
from below, shut in by crags that wear a sterner frown. You
look up to the summit and see the water tumbling through a
ring of rock, so strangely has the disruptive shock there
broken the cliff. The effect both on ear and eye as the torrent
breaks into spray and dashes downwards in fantastic
channels, is surprisingly impressive.</p>

<p>Only on one side is the pass accessible, and there so steep
that your hands must aid in the ascent. We scrambled to
the top and found ourselves on the margin of a table-land
sloping gently upwards from the edge of the precipice, so
bestrewn with upheaved rocks and lumps of stone, that but
for the grass which grows rich and sweet between, whereof
the sheep bite gladly, the aspect would indeed be savage.
Along an irregular furrow, as it may be called, which deepens
as it nears the precipice, flows the beck&mdash;coming, as the boy
told us, from Malham Tarn. There was another small stream,
he said, which disappeared in a &#x2018;swallow&#x2019; on his father&#x2019;s
pasture; and in that swallow he had many times found large
trout, struggling helplessly in their unexpected trap. And,
pointing to the highest shoulder of the cliff, he said that a
fox, once hard pressed by the hounds, had leaped over, followed
by a dog, and both were killed by the fall.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of admiration, the Yorkshiremen and
their guide began to move off across the fell, in search of the
horse. One of them hoped we should meet again on the way
back. The other said, &#x201c;Not much hope o&#x2019; that; for he won&#x2019;t
go away from this till he have learnt it all by heart.&#x201d; Then
we shook hands, and they promised to set up a pile of stones
at a certain gate on their return, as a signal to me that they
had passed through.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>True enough, I was in no haste to depart, and there was
much to admire as well as &#x201c;to learn.&#x201d; The sight of the innumerable
shelves, with their fringe of grass, the diversity of
jagged rocks thrusting their gray heads up into the sunlight,
of the rugged and broken slopes, set me longing for a scramble.
Hither and thither I went; now to a point where I could see
miles of the cliffs, and mark how, in many places, owing to
the splitting and shivering, the limestone wall resembles a row
of organ pipes. Now into a gap all barren and stony with
immemorial screes; where, however, you could hear the faint
tinkle of hidden water, and pulling away the stones, discover
small ferns and pale blades of grass along the course of the
tiny current. Anon, returning to the Scar, I climbed to the
top of the crag that juts midway in the rear of the chasm,
surveying the scene below; then selecting a nook by the side
of the beck, a little above its leap through the ring, I lay
down and watched the water as it ran with innumerable
sparkling cascades from the rise of the fell. Here the solitude
was complete, and the view limited to a few yards of the
hollow water-course patched with green and gray, and the
bright blue sky above.</p>

<p>And while I lay, soothed by the murmur of the water,
looking up at the great white clouds floating slowly across the
blue, certain thoughts that had haunted me for some days
shaped themselves in order in my brain; and with your
permission, gracious reader, I here produce them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A cloud of care had come across my mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ill-balanced hung the world: here pleasure all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There hopeless toil, and cruel pangs that fall<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On Poverty, to which but death seemed kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, with heart perplexed, I left behind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The crowd of men, the town with smoky pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sought the hills, and breathed the mountain wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hath God forgotten then the mean and small?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mused, and gazed o&#x2019;er purple fells outroll&#x2019;d;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When, lo! beneath an old thatched roof a gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That kindled soon with sunset&#x2019;s gorgeous gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Broad panes, nor fretted oriel brighter beam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If glories thus on lattice rude unfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of life unlit by Heaven we may not deem.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sun was beginning to drop towards the west before I
left the pleasant hollow; and then with reluctance, for my
holiday was near its close, and months would elapse before
I should again hear the voice of a mountain brook, and slake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
myself in sunshine. Having returned to the village, I kept
along the river bank to the head of the valley, where copse
and enormous boulders, scattered about the narrow grassy
level and in the bed of the stream, make a fine foreground
to the magnificent limestone cliff of Malham Cove. Rising
sheer to a height of nearly three hundred feet, the precipice
curving inwards, buttressed on each side by woody slopes,
realizes Wordsworth&#x2019;s description&mdash;&#x201c;semicirque profound;&#x201d;
and while you look up at its pale marble-like surface, broken
only by a narrow shelf&mdash;a stripe of green&mdash;accessible to goats
and adventurous boys, you will be ready to say with the bard,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Oh, had this vast theatric structure wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With finished sweep into a perfect round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No mightier work had gained the plausive smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all-beholding Ph&oelig;bus!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At a distance you might well imagine it to be a towering
ruin, from which Time has not yet gnawed the traces of fallen
chambers and colonnades. And perhaps yet more will
you desire to see the cataract which once came rushing down
in one tremendous plunge from the summit, as is said, owing
to some temporary stoppage of the underground channels.
What a glorious fall that must have been! more than twice
the height of Niagara.</p>

<p>From a low flat arch at the base of the cliff, about twenty
feet in width, the river Aire rushes out, copiously fed by a
subterranean source. The water sparkles as it flows forth
into the light of day, and begins its course clear and bright
as truth, yet fated to receive many a defilement ere it pours
into the Ouse. Could the Naiads forsee what is to befall,
how piteous would be their lamentations! The stream is at
once of considerable volume, inhabited by trout, and you may
fish at the very mouth of the arch.</p>

<p>Here, too, I scrambled up and down, crossed and recrossed
the stream, to find all the points of view; then ascending to
the hill-top I traced the line of cliff from the Cove to Gordale.
It is a continuation of that great geological phenomenon already
mentioned&mdash;the Craven fault&mdash;which, extending yet
farther, terminates near Threshfield, the village by which we
passed last Sunday on our way to Kettlewell.</p>

<p>My return walk was quiet enough, and favourable to meditation.
The Yorkshiremen had set up the preconcerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
signal by the gate. I hope the horse did not drive the Scar
quite out of their memory. Perhaps a lasting impression was
made; for &#x201c;Gordale-chasm&#x201d; is, as Wordsworth says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;&mdash;&mdash;terrific as the lair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the young lions couch.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I left Settle by the last evening train, journeying for the
third time over the same ground, and came to the <i>Devonshire
Arms</i> at Keighley just before the doors were locked for the
night.</p>

<p class="hangindent small">Keighley&mdash;Men in Pinafores&mdash;Walk to Haworth&mdash;Charlotte Brontë&#x2019;s Birthplace&mdash;The

<p>Keighley is not pronounced Kayley, as you might suppose,
but Keatley, or Keithley, as some of the natives have it,
flinging in a touch of the guttural. Like Skipton, it is a
stony town; and, as the tall chimneys indicate, gets its living
by converting wool into wearing apparel of sundry kinds.
You meet numbers of men clad in long blue pinafores, from
throat to instep; wool-sorters, who thus protect themselves
from fluff.</p>

<p>The factory people were going to work next morning&mdash;the
youngsters clattering over the pavement in their wooden
clogs&mdash;as I left the town by the Halifax road, for Haworth,
a walk of four miles, and all the way up-hill. The road
runs along one side of a valley, which, when the houses are
left behind, looks pretty with numerous trees and fields of
grass and wheat, and a winding brook, and makes a pleasing
foreground to the view of the town. The road itself is
neither town nor country; the footpaths, as is not uncommon
in Yorkshire, are paved nearly all the way; and houses are
frequent, tenanted by weavers, with here and there a little
shop displaying oaten bread. An hour of ascent and you
come to a cross-road, where, turning to the right for about a
furlong, you see Haworth, piled from base to summit of a
steep hill, the highest point crowned by the church. The
road makes a long bend in approaching the acclivity, which,
if you choose, may be avoided by a cut-off; but coming as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
pilgrim you will perhaps at first desire to see all. You pass
a board which notifies <i>Haworth Town</i>, and then begins the
ascent painfully steep, bounded on one side by houses, on
the other&mdash;where you look into the valley&mdash;by little gardens
and a line of ragged little sheds and hutches. What a wearisome
hill; you will half doubt whether horses can draw a
load up it. Presently we have houses on both sides, and
shops with plate-glass and mahogany mouldings, contrasting
strongly with the general rustic aspect, and the primitive
shop of the <i>Clogger</i>. Some of the windows denote an expectation
of visitors; the apothecary exhibits photographs of
the church, the parsonage, and Mr. Brontë; and no one
seems surprised at your arrival.</p>

<p>The <i>Black Bull</i> stands invitingly on the hill-top. I was
ready for breakfast, and the hostess quite ready to serve; and
while I ate she talked of the family who made Haworth
famous. She knew them all, brother and sisters: Mr. Nicholls
had preached the day before in the morning; Mr.
Brontë in the afternoon. It was mostly in the afternoon that
the old gentleman preached, and he delivered his sermon
without a book. The people felt sorry for his bereavements;
and they all liked Mr. Nicholls. She had had a good many
visitors, but expected &#x201c;a vast&#x201d; before the summer was over.</p>

<p>From the inn to the churchyard is but a few paces. The
church is ugly enough to have had a Puritan for architect;
and there, just beyond the crowded graves, stands the parsonage,
as unsmiling as the church. After I had looked at it
from a distance, and around on the landscape, which, in summer
dress, is not dreary, though bounded by dark moors, the
sexton came and admitted me to the church. He points to
the low roof, and quotes Milton, and leads you to the family
pew, and shows you the corner where <i>she</i>&mdash;that is, Charlotte&mdash;used
to sit; and against the wall, but a few feet from this
corner, you see the long plain memorial stone, with its melancholy
list of names. As they descend, the inscriptions crowd
close together; and beneath the lowest, that which records
the decease of her who wrote <i>Jane Eyre</i>, there remains but a
narrow blank for those which are to follow.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> This stone, as stated in the newspapers, has since been replaced by a larger
one, with sculptured ornaments.</p></div>

<p>Then the sexton, turning away to the vestry, showed me in
the marriage register the signatures of Charlotte Brontë, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
husband, and father; and next, his collection of photographs,
with an intimation that they were for sale. When he saw
that I had not the slightest inclination to become a purchaser,
to have seen the place was quite enough; he said, that if I
had a card to send in the old gentleman would see me. It
seemed to me, I replied, that the greatest kindness a stranger
could show to the venerable pastor, would be, not to intrude
upon him.</p>

<p>On some of the pews I noticed small plates affixed, notifying
that Mr. Mudbeck of Windytop Farm, or some other parishioner
of somewhere else, &#x201c;hath&#x201d; three sittings, or four and a
quarter, and so forth; and this invasion by &#x2018;vested rights&#x2019;
of the house of prayer and thanksgiving, appeared to me as
the finishing touch of its unattractive features.</p>

<p>The sexton invited me to ascend the tower, but discovered
that the key was missing; so, as I could not delay, I made
a brief excursion on the moor behind the house, where heather-bloom
masked the sombre hue; and then walked back to
Keighley, and took the train for Shipley, the nearest station
to Saltaire.</p>

<p>It was the day of Shipley feast, and the place was all in a
hubbub, and numbers of factory people, leaving for a while
their habitual manufacture of woollen goods out of a mixture
of woollen and cotton, had come together to enjoy themselves.
But no one seemed happy except the children; the men and
women looked as if they did not know what to do with themselves.
I took the opportunity to scan faces, and could not
fail to be struck by the general ill-favoured expression.
Whatever approach towards good looks that there was, clearly
lay with the men; the women were positively ugly, and
numbers of them remarkable for that protruding lower jaw
which so characterizes many of the Irish peasantry.</p>

<p>Saltaire is about a mile from Shipley. It is a new settlement
in an old country; a most noteworthy example of what
enterprise can and will accomplish where trade confides in
political and social security. Here, in an agreeable district of
the valley of the Aire&mdash;wooded hills on both sides&mdash;a magnificent
factory and dependent town have been built, and with
so much judgment as to mitigate or overcome the evils to
which towns and factories have so long been obnoxious. The
factory is built of stone in pure Italian style, and has a truly
palatial appearance. What would the Plantagenets say, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
they come back to life, and see trade inhabiting palaces far
more stately than those of kings? The main building, of six
stories, is seventy-two feet in height, and five hundred and
fifty feet in length. In front, at some distance, standing quite
apart, rises the great chimney, to an elevation of two hundred
and fifty feet; a fine ornamental object, built to resemble a
campanile.</p>

<p>The site is well chosen on the right bank of the Aire,
between the Leeds and Liverpool canal, and the Leeds and
Lancaster railway. Hence the readiest means are available
for the reception and despatch of merchandise. A little apart,
extending up the gentle slope, the young town of Saltaire is
built, and in such a way as to realize the aspirations of a sanitary
reformer. The houses are ranged in parallelograms, of
which I counted sixteen, the fronts looking into a spacious
street; the backs into a lane about seven feet in width, which
facilitates ventilation, admits the scavenger&#x2019;s cart, and serves
as drying-ground. Streets and lanes are completely paved,
the footways are excellent; there is a pillar post-office, and
no lack of gas-lamps. The number of shopkeepers is regulated
by Messrs. Salt, the owners of the property; and while one
baker and grocer suffices to supply the wants of the town
others will not be allowed to come in. A congregational
chapel affords place for religious worship, and a concert-hall
for musical recreation, or lectures, The men who wish to
tipple must go down to Shipley, for Saltaire, as yet, has no
public-house. If I mistake not, the owners are unwilling
that there shall be one.</p>

<p>My request for leave to look in-doors was readily granted.
The ordinary class of houses have a kitchen with oven and
boiler, a sink and copper; a parlour, or &#x2018;house&#x2019; in the vernacular,
two bedrooms, and a small back-yard, with out-offices.
The floors, mantlepiece, and stairs, are of stone. The
rent is 3s. 1d. a week. Gas is laid on at an extra charge, and
the tenant finds burners. The supply of water is ample, but
the water is hard, and has a smack of peat-bog in its flavour.
A woman whom I saw washing, told me the water lost much
of its hardness if left to stand awhile. Each house has a back-door
opening into the lane; and every stercorarium voids into
the ash-pit, which is cleared out once a week at the landlord&#x2019;s
cost. The pits are all accessible by a small trap-door from
the lane; hence there is no intrusion on the premises in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
work of cleansing. The drainage in other respects is well
cared for; and the whole place is so clean and substantial,
with handsome fronts to the principal rows, that you feel
pleasure in observing it.</p>

<p>The central and corner houses are a story higher than the
rest, and what with these and the handsome rows above
referred to, there is accommodation for all classes of the
employed&mdash;spinners, overlookers, and clerks. After building
two or three of the parallelograms, it was discovered that
cellars were desirable, and since then every house has its
cellar, in which, as the woman said, &#x201c;we can keep our meat
and milk sweet in hot weather.&#x201d; What a contrast, I thought,
to the one closet in a lodging in some large town, where the
food is kept side by side with soap and candles, the duster,
and scrubbing-brush! And though the stone floors look
chilly, coal is only fivepence-halfpenny a hundred-weight.</p>

<p>No one is allowed to live in the town who is not in some
way employed by the firm. Most of the tenants to whom I
spoke, expressed themselves well satisfied with their quarters,
but two or three thought the houses dear; they could get a
place down at Shipley, or Shipla, as they pronounced it, for
two-and-sixpence a week. I put a question to the baker:
&#x201c;I isn&#x2019;t the gaffer,&#x201d; he answered.</p>

<p>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; I replied; &#x201c;if you are not the master, we
can talk all the same.&#x201d;</p>

<p>He thought we could; and he too was one of those who did
not like the new town. &#x2019;Twas too dear. He lived at Shipla,
and paid but four pounds a year for a house with a cellar
under it, and a garden behind; and there he kept a pig, which
was not permitted at Saltaire. There was &#x201c;a vast&#x201d; worked
in the mill who did not live under Mr. Salt; they came from
Bradford, and a train, called the Saltaire train, &#x201c;brought &#x2019;em
in the morning, and fetched &#x2019;em home at night.&#x201d;</p>

<p>The railway runs between the town and the factory. You
cross by a handsome stone bridge, quite in keeping with the
prevalent style of architecture. The hands were returning
from dinner as I approached after my survey of the colony,
and the prodigious clatter of clogs was well-nigh deafening.
My letter of introduction procured me the favour of Mr.
George Salt&#x2019;s guidance. First, he showed me a model of the
premises, by which I saw that a six-story wing, if such it
may be called, comprising the warehouses, projects at a right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
angle from the rear of the main building, with the combing-shed
on one side, the weaving-shed on the other. In that
combing-shed 3500 persons sat down in perfect comfort to a
house-warming dinner. The weaving-shed is twice as large.
Then there are the workshops of the smiths, machinists, and
other artisans; packing, washing, and drying-rooms, and a
gasometer to maintain five thousand lights; so that in all the
buildings cover six acres and a half. Include the whole of the
floors, and the space is twelve acres. Rails are laid from the
line in front into the ground-floor of the building; hence
there is no porterage, no loading and unloading except by
machinery; and the canal at the back is equally convenient
for water-carriage. In front the ground is laid out as an
ornamental shrubbery, terminated at one corner by the graceful
campanile.</p>

<p>Then I was conducted to the boilers, a row of ten, sunk
underground in the solid rock, below the level of the shrubbery.
They devour one hundred and twenty tons of coal in
a week; but with economy, for the tall chimney pours out
no clouds of dense black smoke. The prevention is accomplished
by careful feeding, and leaving the furnace-door open
half an inch, to admit a full stream of air. I was amazed at
the sight of such a range of boilers, and yet they were not
enough, and an excavation was making to receive others.</p>

<p>Then to the engine-room, where the sight of the tremendous
machinery was a fresh surprise. Here are erected two
separate pairs of engines, combining 1250-horse power, by
Fairbairn, of Manchester. You see how beauty of construction
consorts with ponderous strength. Polished iron, glittering
brass, and shining mahogany, testify to the excellence of
Lancashire handicraft in 1853, the date of the engines. The
mahogany is used for casing; and here, as with the boilers,
every precaution is used to prevent the escape of heat. As
you watch the great cogged fly-wheels spinning round with
resistless force, you will hardly be surprised to hear that they
impart motion to two miles of &#x2018;shafting,&#x2019; which weighs
in all six hundred tons, and rotates from sixty to two
hundred and fifty times a minute. And this shafting, of
which the diameter is from two to fourteen inches, sets twelve
hundred power-looms going, besides fulfilling all its other
multifarious duties.</p>

<p>Then we went from one noisy floor to another among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
troops of spinners, finding everywhere proofs of the same
presiding judgment. All is fire-proof; the beams and columns
are of cast-iron; the floors rest on arches of hollow
bricks; and the ventilation, maintained by inlets a few inches
above the floor, and outlets near the ceiling, where hot-water
pipes keep up a temperature of sixty degrees, is perfect,
without draughts. The top room in the main building,
running from end to end for five hundred and fifty feet
without a break, said to be the largest room in Europe, is
an impressive sight, filled with ranks of busy machines and
busy workers.</p>

<p>In the weaving-shed, all the driving gear is placed beneath
the floor, so that you have a clear prospect over the whole
area at once, uninterrupted by the usual array of rapid
wheels and flying straps. Vast as is the appetite of those
twelve hundred looms for warp and weft, it is kept satisfied
from the mill&#x2019;s own resources; and in one day they deliver
thirty thousand yards of alpaca, or other kinds of woollen
cloth. Multiply that quantity, reader, by the number of
working days in a year, and you will discover to what an
amazing extent the markets of the world are supplied by
this one establishment of Titus Salt and Co.</p>

<p>Some portions of the machinery do their work with marvellous
precision and dexterity,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;&mdash;&mdash;as if the iron thought!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and it seemed to me that I could never have tired of watching
the machine that took the wool, one fringe-like instalment
after another, from assiduous cylinders, and delivered
it to another series of movements which placed the fibres all
in one direction, and produced the rough outline of the
future thread. Another ingenious device weaves two pieces
at once all in one width, and with four selvages, of which
two are, of course, in the middle of the web, and yet there
is no difference in appearance between those two inner ones
and those on the outer edges. The piece is afterwards
divided along the narrow line left between them. Even in
the noisome washing-room there was something to admire.
The wool, after a course of pushing to and fro in a cistern
of hot water by two great rakes, is delivered to an endless
web by a revolving cylinder. This cylinder is armed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
rows of long brass teeth, and as they would be in the way
of the web on their descent, they disappear within the body
of the cylinder at the critical moment, and come presently
forth again to continue their lift.</p>

<p>In the warehouse, I was shown that the wool is sorted into
eight qualities, sometimes a ninth; and the care bestowed
on this preliminary operation may be judged of from the
fact, that every sorting passes in succession through two sets
of hands. There, too, I learned that the first fleece of
Gimmer hogs is among the best of English wool; and, indeed,
it feels quite silky in comparison with other kinds.
The quality loses in goodness with every subsequent shearing.
The clippings and refuse are purchased by the shoddy
makers, those ingenious converters of old clothes into new.</p>

<p>Where alpaca and other fine cloths are so largely manufactured,
the question as to a continuous supply of finest
wool becomes of serious importance. Mr. Salt has done
what he can to provide for a supply by introducing the
alpaca sheep into Australia and the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>On my coming, I had thought the counting-house, and
offices, and visitors&#x2019; room too luxurious for a mere place of
business; but when I returned thither to take leave, with
the impression of the enormous scale of the business, and
the means by which it is accomplished fresh on my mind,
these appeared quite in harmony with all the rest. And
when I stood, taking a last look around, on the railway
bridge, I felt that he whose large foresight had planned so
stately a home for industry, and set it down here in a sylvan
valley, deserved no mean place among the Worthies of
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>I walked back to Shipley, and there spent some time
sauntering to and fro in the throng, which had greatly increased
during the afternoon. There was no increase of
amusement, however, with increase of numbers; and the
chief diversion seemed to consist in watching the swings and
roundabouts, and eating gingerbread. Now and then little
troops of damsels elbowed their way through, bedizened in
such finery as would have thrown a negro into ecstacies.
&#x201c;That caps me!&#x201d; cried a young man, as one of the parties
went past, outvying all the rest in staring colours.</p>

<p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a vast of &#x2019;em coom t&#x2019; feast, isn&#x2019;t there?&#x201d; replied
his companion; &#x201c;and there &#x2019;ll be more, afore noight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Look at Bobby,&#x201d; said an aunt of her little nephew, who
had been disappointed of a cake; &#x201c;Look at Bobby! He&#x2019;s fit
to cry.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s ta do?&#x201d; shouted a countryman, as he was pushed
rudely aside; &#x201c;runnin&#x2019; agean t&#x2019; foaks! What d&#x2019;ye come
poakin yer noase thro&#x2019; here for?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Ah&#x2019;m puzzeld wi&#x2019; t&#x2019; craad&#x201d; (crowd), answered the
offender.</p>

<p>After hearing many more fragments of West Riding dialect,
I forced my way to the railway-station, and went to
Bradford. Few towns show more striking evidences of
change than this; and the bits of old Bradford, little one-story
tenements with stone roofs, left standing among tall
and handsome warehouses, strengthen the contrast. Bradford
and Leeds, only nine miles apart, have been looked
upon as rivals; and it was said that no sooner did one town
erect a new building than the other built one larger or handsomer;
and now Bradford boasts its St. George&#x2019;s Hall, and
Leeds its Town Hall, crowned by a lofty tower. But what
avails a tower, even two hundred and forty feet high, when
a letter was once received, addressed, &#x201c;<i>Leeds, near Bradford!</i>&#x201d;</p>

<p>Your Yorkshireman of the West Riding is, so Mrs.
Gaskell says, &#x201c;a sleuth-hound&#x201d; after money. As there is
nothing like testimony, let me end this chapter with a brace
of anecdotes, and you, reader, may draw your own inference.</p>

<p>Not far from Bradford, an old couple lived on their farm.
The good man had been ill for some time, when the practitioner
who attended him advised that a physician should
be summoned from Bradford for a consultation. The doctor
came, looked into the case, gave his opinion; and descending
from the sick-room to the kitchen, was there accosted by the
old woman, with,</p>

<p>&#x201c;Well, doctor, what&#x2019;s your charge?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;My fee is a guinea.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;A guinea,&mdash;doctor! a guinea! And if ye come again
will it be another guinea?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Yes; but I shall hardly have to come again. I have
given my opinion, and leave the patient in very good
hands.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;A guinea, doctor! Hech!&#x201d;</p>

<p>The old woman rose, went upstairs to her husband&#x2019;s bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>side,
and the doctor, who waited below, heard her say, &#x201c;He
charges a guinea. And if he comes again, it&#x2019;ll be another
guinea. Now what do ye say?&mdash;If I were ye, I&#x2019;d say no,
like a Britoner; and I&#x2019;d die first!&#x201d;</p>

<p>Though very brief, the other illustration is not less demonstrative.
A friend of mine, whose brother had just been
married, happening to mention the incident to a friend of his,
during a visit to the town, was immediately met by the
question:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Money?&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p>

<p>&#x201c;Fool!&#x201d; was Bradford&#x2019;s reply.</p>

Dialect&mdash;Sheffield.</p>

<p>&#x201c;What is Bradford famous for?&#x201d; was the question put
at a school-examination somewhere within the West Riding.</p>

<p>&#x201c;For its shoddy,&#x201d; answered one of the boys. An answer
that greatly scandalized certain of the parents who had
come from Bradford; and not without reason, for although
shoddy is manufactured within sight of the smoke of the
town, Bradford is really the great mart for stuffs and worsted
goods, as Leeds is for broadcloth.</p>

<p>I had seen how stuffs were made, and wished now to see
in what manner they were sent into the market. A clerk
who came to the inn during the evening for a glass of ale
and gossip, invited me to visit the warehouse in which he
was employed, on the following morning. I went, and as
he had not repented of his invitation, I saw all he had to
show, and then, at his suggestion, went to the &#x2018;crack&#x2019;
warehouse of Bradford, where business is carried on with
elegant and somewhat luxurious appliances. I handed my
card to a gentleman in the office, and was not surprised
to hear for answer that strangers could not be admitted
for obvious reasons, and was turning away, when he said,
musingly, that my name seemed familiar to him, and after
a little reflection, he added: &#x201c;Yes, yes&mdash;now I have it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
was on the title-page of <i>A Londoner&#x2019;s Walk to the Land&#x2019;s
End</i>. How that book made me long for a trip to Cornwall!
And you are the Londoner! Well, of course you shall see
the warehouse.&#x201d;</p>

<p>So I was introduced into the lift, and away we were
hoisted up to the fifth or sixth story, when I was first led to
the gazebo on the roof, that I might enjoy the prospect of
the town and neighbourhood. What a prospect! a great
mass of houses, and rounded heights beyond, dimly seen
through a rolling canopy of smoke. The sky of London is
brilliant in comparison. May it never be my doom to live in
Bradford, or Leeds, or Sheffield, or Manchester!</p>

<p>We soon exchanged the dismal outlook for the topmost
floor, where I saw heaps of &#x2018;tabs,&#x2019; stacks of boards, boxes,
and paper for packing. The tabs, which are the narrow
strips that hang out from the ends of the pieces while on
show, are kept for a time as references. The number and
variety of the boards, on which the pieces are wound, are
surprising: some are thick, to add bulk and weight to the
piece of stuff in which it is to be enveloped; some thin, to
save cost in transport; some broad, some narrow, so that
every market may have its whims and wants gratified.
The Germans who pay heavily for carriage, prefer thin
boards: Brother Jonathan as well as John Bull, likes the
sight of a good pennyworth, and gets a thick board. The
preparation of these boards alone must be no insignificant
branch of trade in Bradford; and remembering how many
warehouses in other towns use up stacks of boards every
month, we see a large consumption of Norway timber at
once accounted for.</p>

<p>I saw the press cutting the slips of white paper in which
the pieces are tied, and tickets and fancy bands and labels
intended to tickle the eyes of customers, without end. A
peculiar kind of embossed paper, somewhat resembling a
rough towel, is provided to wrap up the American purchases;
and Brother Jonathan requires that his pieces should be
folded in a peculiar way, so that he may show the quality
without loss of time when selling to his own impatient
countrymen. Nimble machines measure the pieces at the rate
of a thousand yards an hour, and others wind the lengths
promptly on the boards; and, judging from appearances,
clerks, salesmen, and porters work as if they too were ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>tuated
by the steam. And then, while descending from floor
to floor, to see the prodigious piles of pieces on racks and
shelves, or awaiting their turn in the hydraulic press which
packs them solid as a bastion, was a wonder. There were
moreen, bombazine, alpaca, camlet, orleans, berége, Australian
cord, cable cord, and many kinds as new to me as
they would have been to a fakir. One heavy black stuff was
pointed out as manufactured purposely for the vestments of
Romish priests. And running through each room I saw a
small lift, in which account books, orders, patterns, and such
like, are passed up and down, and now and then a signal to a
clerk to be cautious of pushing sales. And, lastly, on the
ground-floor I saw the handsome dining-room, wherein many
a customer had enjoyed the hospitality of the firm, and drunk
the generous sherry that inspired him to buy up to a thousand
when he purposed only five hundred.</p>

<p>This brief sketch includes the two warehouses; one, however&mdash;the
elegant one&mdash;confines itself to the home trade. I
made due acknowledgments for the favour shown to me, and
hastening to the railway-station, took the train for Mirfield.
The line passes the great Lowmoor iron-works, where furnaces,
little mountains of ore, coal, limestone, and iron, and
cranes and trucks, and overwhelming smoke, and a general
blackness, suggest ideas of Vulcan and his tremendous smithy.
And besides there is a stir, and a going to and fro, that betoken
urgent work; and you will believe a passenger&#x2019;s remark, that
&#x201c;Lowmoor could of itself keep a railway going.&#x201d; We pass
Cleckheaton and Heckmondwike, places that have something
sylvan in the sound of their names; but although the country
if left to itself would be pretty enough, it is sadly disfigured
by smoke and the remorseless inroads of trade. Yet who can
travel here in the West Riding and not be struck by the busy
traffic, the sight of chimneys, quarries, canals, and tramways,
and trains heavy laden, coming and going continually! And
connected with this traffic there is one particular especially
worthy of imitation in other counties: it is, that nearly every
train throughout the day has third-class carriages.</p>

<p>Mirfield is in the pleasant valley of the Calder. While
waiting for a train to Batley, I walked along the bank of the
stream thinking of Robin Hood, who lies buried at Kirklees,
a few miles up the valley, where a treacherous hand let out
his life:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<span class="i2">Here lies bold Robin Hood.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The object of my visit to Batley was to see the making of
shoddy. To leave Yorkshire ignorant of one of our latest
national institutions would be a reproach. We live in an age
of shoddy, in more senses than one. You may begin with the
hovel, and trace shoddy all through society, even up to the
House of Peers. I had not long to wait: there was a bird&#x2019;s-eye
view of Dewsbury in passing, and a few minutes brought
me to Batley, the head-quarters of shoddy. On alighting at
the station, the sight of great pockets or bales piled up in
stacks or laden on trucks, every bale branded <i>Anvers</i>, and
casks of oil from <i>Sevila</i>, gave me at once a proof that I had
come to the right place; for here were rags shipped at Antwerp
from all parts of northern Europe. Think of that.
Hither were brought tatters from pediculous Poland, from the
gipsies of Hungary, from the beggars and scarecrows of Germany,
from the frowsy peasants of Muscovy; to say nothing
of snips and shreds from monks&#x2019; gowns and lawyers&#x2019; robes,
from postilions&#x2019; jackets and soldiers&#x2019; uniforms, from maidens&#x2019;
bodices and noblemen&#x2019;s cloaks. A vast medley, truly! and
all to be manufactured into broadcloth in Yorkshire. No
wonder that the <i>Univers</i> declares England is to perish by her
commerce.</p>

<p>The walk to the town gives you such a view as can only be
seen in a manufacturing district: hills, fields, meadows, and
rough slopes, all bestrewn with cottages, factories, warehouses,
sheds, clouded here and there by smoke; roads and paths
wandering apparently anywhere; here and there a quarry,
and piles of squared stone; heaps of refuse; wheat-fields
among the houses; potato-plots in little levels, and everything
giving you the impression of waiting to be finished. Add to
all this, troops of men and women, boys and girls&mdash;the girls
with a kerchief pinned over the head, the corner hanging
behind&mdash;going home to dinner, and a mighty noise of clogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and trucks laden with rags and barrels of oil, and you will
have an idea of Batley, as I saw it on my arrival.</p>

<p>Having found the factory of which I was in search, I had
to wait a few minutes for the appearance of the principal. A
boy, who was amusing himself in the office, remarked, when
he heard that I had never yet seen shoddy made: &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;ll
cap ye when ye get among the machinery; that&#x2019;s all!&#x201d; He
himself had been capt once in his life: it was in the previous
summer, when his uncle took him to Blackpool, and he first
beheld the sea. &#x201c;That capt me, that did,&#x201d; he said, with the
gravity of a philosopher.</p>

<p>Seeing that the principal hesitated, even after he had read
my letter, I began to imagine that shoddy-making involved
important secrets. &#x201c;Come to see what you can pick up, eh?&#x201d;
he said. However, when he heard that I was in no way
connected with manufactures, and had come, not as a spy, but
simply out of honest curiosity, to see how old rags were
ground into new cloth, he smiled, and led me forthwith into
the devil&#x2019;s den. There I saw a cylinder revolving with a
velocity too rapid for the eye to follow, whizzing and roaring,
as if in agony, and throwing off a cloud of light woolly fibres,
that floated in the air, and a stream of flocks that fell in a heap
at the end of the room. It took three minutes to stop the
monster; and when the motion ceased, I saw the cylinder
was full of blunt steel teeth, which, seizing whatever was presented
to them in the shape of rags, tore it thoroughly to
pieces; in fact, ground it up into flocks of short, frizzly-looking
fibre, resembling negro-hair, yet soft and free from
knots. The cylinder is fed by a travelling web, which brings
a layer of rags continually up to the teeth. On this occasion,
the quality of the grist, as one might call it, was respectable&mdash;nothing
but fathoms of list which had never been defiled.
So rapidly did the greedy devil devour it, that the two attendant
imps were kept fully employed in feeding; and fast as
the pack of rags diminished, the heap of flocks increased.
And so, amid noise and dust, the work goes on day after day;
and the man who superintends, aided by his two boys, earns
four pounds a week, grinding the rags as they come, for thirty
shillings a pack.</p>

<p>The flocks are carried away to the mixing-house. As we
turned aside, the devil began to whirl once more; and before
we had entered the other door, I heard the ferocious howl in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
full vigour. The road between the buildings was encumbered
with oil-casks, pieces of cloth, lying in the dust, as if of no
value, and packs of rags. &#x201c;It will all come right by-and-by,&#x201d;
said the chief, as I pointed to the littery heaps; and, pausing
by one of the packs which contained what he called &#x2018;mungo,&#x2019;
that is, shreds of such cloth as clergymen&#x2019;s coats are made of,
he made me aware that there is shoddy and shoddy. That
which makes the longest fibre is, of course, the best; and some
of the choice sorts are worked up into marketable cloth, without
a fresh dyeing.</p>

<p>Great masses of the flocks, with passage-ways between, lay
heaped on the stone floor of the mixing-house. Here, according
to the quality required, the long fibre is mixed in certain
proportions with the short; and to facilitate the subsequent
operations, the several heaps are lightly sprinkled with oil.
A dingy brown or black was the prevalent colour; but some
of the heaps were gray, and would be converted into undyed
cloth of the same colour. It seemed to me that the principal
ingredient therein was old worsted stockings; and yet, before
many days, those heaps would become gray cloth fit for the
jackets and mantles of winsome maidens.</p>

<p>I asked my conductor if it were true, as I had heard, that
shoddy-makers purchased the waste, begrimed cotton wads
with which stokers and &#x2018;engine-tenters&#x2019; wipe the machinery,
or the dirty refuse of wool-sorters, or every kind of
ragged rubbish. He did not think such things were done in
Batley; for his part, he used none but best rags, and could
keep two factories always going. He had heard of the man
who spread greasy cotton-waste over his field, and who, when
the land had absorbed all the grease, gathered up the cotton,
and sold it to the shoddy-makers; but he doubted the truth of
the story. True or not, it implies great toleration among a
certain class of manufacturers. Rags, not good enough for
shoddy, are used as manure for the hops in Kent; so we get
shoddy in our beer as well as in our broadcloth.</p>

<p>In the next process, the flocks are intimately mixed by
passing over and under a series of rollers, and come forth
from the last looking something like wool. Then the wool,
as we may now call it, goes to the &#x2018;scribbling-machine,&#x2019;
which, after torturing it among a dozen rollers of various
dimensions, delivers it yard by yard in the form of a loose
thick cable, with a run of the fibres in one direction. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
carding-machine takes the cable lengths, subjects them to
another course of torture, confirms the direction of the fibres,
and reduces the cable into a chenille of about the thickness
of a lady&#x2019;s finger. This chenille is produced in lengths of
about five feet, across the machine, parallel with the rollers,
and is immediately transferred to the piecing-machine, by a
highly ingenious process. Each length, as it is finished,
drops into a long, narrow, tin tray; the tray moves forward;
the next behind it receives a chenille; then the third; then
the fourth; and so on, up to ten. By this time, they have
advanced over a table on which lies what may be described as
a wooden gridiron; there is a momentary pause, and then the
ten trays, turning all at once upside down, drop the chenilles
severally between the bars of the gridiron. At one side of
the table is a row of large spindles, or rollers, on which the
chenilles&mdash;cardings, is the factory word&mdash;are wound, and the
dropping is so contrived that the ends of those which fall
overlap the ends of the lengths on the spindles by about an
inch. Now the gridiron begins to vibrate, and by its movement
beats the ends together; joins each chenille, in fact, to
the one before it; then the spindles whirl, and draw in the
lengths, leaving only enough for the overlap; and no sooner
is this accomplished than the ten trays drop another supply,
which is treated in the same expeditious manner, until the
spindles are filled. No time is lost, for the full ones are
immediately replaced by empty ones.</p>

<p>Now comes the spinners&#x2019; turn. They take these full spindles,
submit them to the action of their machinery by dozens
at a time, and spin the large, loose chenilles into yarns of different
degrees of strength and fineness, or, perhaps one should
say, coarseness, ready for the weavers. And in this way
those heaps of short, uncompliant negro-hair, in which you
could hardly find a fibre three inches long, are transformed
into long, continuous threads, able to bear the rapid jerks of
the loom. I could not sufficiently admire its ingenuity. Who
would have imagined that among the appliances of shoddy!
Moreover, wages are good at Batley, and the spinners can earn
from forty to forty-five shillings a week. The women who
attend the looms earn nine or eighteen shillings a week,
according as they weave one or two pieces.</p>

<p>Next comes the fulling process: the pieces are damped,
and thumped for a whole day by a dozen ponderous mallets;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
then the raising of the pile on one or both sides of the cloth,
either by rollers or by hand. In the latter case, two men
stretch a piece as high as they can reach on a vertical frame,
and scratch the surface downwards with small hand-cards,
the teeth of which are fine steel wire. Genuine broadcloth
can only be dressed by a teazel of Nature&#x2019;s own growing;
but shoddy, far less delicate, submits to the metal. So the
men keep on, length after length, till the piece is finished.
Then the dyers have their turn, and if you venture to walk
through their sloppy, steamy department, you will see men
stirring the pieces about in vats, and some pieces hanging to
rollers which keep them for a while running through the
liquor. From the dye-house the pieces are carried to the
tenter-ground and stretched in one length on vertical posts;
and after a sufficient course of sun and air, they undergo
the finishing process&mdash;clipping the surface and hot-pressing.</p>

<p>From what I saw in the tenter-ground, I discovered that
pilot cloth is shoddy; that glossy beavers and silky-looking
mohairs are shoddy; that the Petershams so largely exported
to the United States are shoddy; that the soft, delicate cloths
in which ladies feel so comfortable, and look so graceful,
are shoddy; that the &#x2018;fabric&#x2019; of Talmas, Raglans, and paletots,
and of other garments in which fine gentlemen go to
the Derby, or to the Royal Academy Exhibition, or to the
evening services in Westminster Abbey, are shoddy. And
if Germany sends us abundance of rags, we send to Germany
enormous quantities of shoddy in return. The best quality
manufactured at Batley is worth ten shillings a yard; the
commonest not more than one shilling.</p>

<p>Broadcloth at a shilling a yard almost staggers credibility.
After that we may truly say that shoddy is a great leveller.</p>

<p>The workpeople are, with few exceptions, thrifty and persevering.
Some of the spinners take advantage of their good
wages to build cottages and become landlords. A walk
through Batley shows you that thought has been taken for
their spiritual and moral culture; and in fine weather they
betake themselves for out-doors recreation to an ancient
manor-house, which I was told is situate beyond the hill
that rears its pleasant woods aloft in sight of the factories.</p>

<p>The folk of the surrounding districts are accustomed to
make merry over the shoddy-makers, regarding them as
Gibeonites, and many a story do they tell concerning these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
clever conjurors, and their transformations of old clothes
into new. Once, they say, a portly Quaker walked into
Batley, just as the &#x2018;mill-hands&#x2019; were going to dinner: he
came from the west, and was clad in that excellent broadcloth
which is the pride of Gloucestershire. &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; cried
the hands, as he passed among them&mdash;&#x201c;hey! look at that
now! There&#x2019;s a bit of real cloth. Lookey, lookey! we
never saw the like afore:&#x201d; and they surrounded the worthy
stranger, and kept him prisoner until they had all felt the
texture of his coat, and expressed their admiration.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Again, while waiting at Mirfield, was I struck by the frequency
of trains, and counted ten in an hour and a half. In
1856, a million and quarter tons of iron ore were dug in the
Cleveland and Whitby districts; and the quantity of pig-iron
made in Yorkshire was 275,600 tons, of which the
West Riding produced 96,000. In the same year 8986
tons of lead, and 302 ounces of silver were made within
the county; and Yorkshire furnished 9,000,000 towards the
sixty millions tons and a half of coal dug in all the kingdom.</p>

<p>I journeyed on to Wakefield; and, as it proved, to a disappointment.
I had hoped for a sight of Walton Hall, and
of the well-known naturalist, who there fulfils the rites of
hospitality with a generous hand. Through a friend of his,
Mr. Waterton had assured me of a welcome; but on arriving
at Wakefield, I heard that he had started the day before for
the Continent. So, instead of a walk to the Hall, I resolved
to go on to Sheffield, by the last train. This left me time
for a ramble. I went down to the bridge, and revived my
recollections of the little chapel which for four hundred years
has shown its rich and beautiful front to all who there cross
the Calder, and I rejoiced to see that it had been restored
and was protected by a railing. It was built&mdash;some say renewed&mdash;by
Edward the Fourth to the memory of those
who fell in the battle of Wakefield&mdash;a battle fatal to the
House of York&mdash;and fatal to the victors; for the cruelties
there perpetrated by Black Clifford and other knights, were
repaid with tenfold vengeance at Towton. The place where
Richard, Duke of York, fell, may still be seen: and near it,
a little more than a mile from the town, the eminence on
which stood Sandal Castle, a fortress singularly picturesque,
as shown in old engravings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>After a succession of stony towns and smoky towns, there
was something cheerful in the distant view of Wakefield
with its clean red brick. It has some handsome streets; and
in the old thoroughfares you may see relics of the mediæval
times in ancient timbered houses. Leland describes it as &#x201c;a
very quick market town, and meatly large, the whole profit
of which standeth by coarse drapery.&#x201d; You will soon learn
by a walk through the streets that &#x201c;very quick&#x201d; still applies.</p>

<p>Signs of manufactures are repeated as Wakefield, with
its green neighbourhood, is left behind, and at Barnsley
the air is again darkened by smoke. We had to change
trains here, and thought ourselves lucky in finding that the
Sheffield train had for once condescended to lay aside its
surly impatience, and await the arrival from Wakefield.
As we pushed through the throng on the platform, I heard
many a specimen of the vernacular peculiar to Bairnsla, as
the natives call it. How shall one who has not spent years
among them essay to reproduce the sounds? Fortunately
there is a <i>Bairnsla Foaks&#x2019; Almanack</i> in which the work is
done ready to our hand; and here is a passage quoted from
<i>Tom Treddlehoyle&#x2019;s Peep at T&#x2019; Manchister Exhebishan</i>, giving
us a notion of the sort of dialect talked by the Queen&#x2019;s subjects
in this part of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Tom is looking about and &#x201c;moralizin&#x2019;,&#x201d; when &#x201c;a strange

<p>We went on a few miles to a little station called Wombwell,
where we had again to change trains. But the train
from Doncaster had not arrived; so while the passengers
waited they dispersed themselves about the sides of the railway,
finding seats on the banks or fences, and sat talking in
groups, and wondering at the delay. The stars shone out,
twinkling brightly, before the train came up, more than an
hour beyond its time, and it was late when we reached
Sheffield. I turned at a venture into the first decent-looking
public-house in <i>The Wicker</i>, and was rewarded by finding
good entertainment and thorough cleanliness.</p>

<p>When I woke in the morning and saw what a stratum of
&#x2018;blacks&#x2019; had come in at the window during the night, I admired
still more the persevering virtue which maintains
cleanliness under such very adverse circumstances. We commonly
think the London atmosphere bad; but it is purity
compared with Sheffield. The town, too, is full of strange,
uncouth noises, by night as well as by day, that send their
echo far. I had been woke more than once by ponderous
thumps and sounding shocks, which made me fancy the
Cyclops themselves were taking a turn at the hammers.
Sheffield raised a regiment to march against the Sepoys;
why not raise a company to put down its own pestiferous
blacks?</p>

<p>Who would think that here grew the many-leagued oak
forests in which Gurth and Wamba roamed; that in a later
day, when the Talbots were lords of the domain, there were
trees in the park under which a hundred horses might find
shelter? Here lived that famous Talbot, the terror of the
French; here George, the fourth Earl, built a mansion in
which Wolsey lodged while on his way to die at Leicester;
here the Queen of Scots was kept for a season in durance;
here, as appears by a Court Roll, dated 1590, the Right
Honorable George Earl of Shrewsbury assented to the trade
regulations of &#x201c;the Fellowship and Company of Cutlers and
Makers of Knives,&#x201d; whose handicraft was even then an an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>cient
one, for Chaucer mentions the &#x201c;Shefeld thwitel.&#x201d;
Now, what with furnaces and forges, rolling mills, and the
many contrivances used by the men of iron and steel, the
landscape is spoiled of its loveliness, and Silence is driven to
remoter haunts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sheffield is renowned for its knives
and files all over the world. It boasts a People&#x2019;s College and
a Philosophical Society. With it are associated the names
of Chantrey, Montgomery, and Ebenezer Elliott. When
you see the place, you will not wonder that Elliott&#x2019;s poetry
is what it is; for how could a man be expected to write
amiable things in such a detestable town?</p>

<p>Ever since my conversation with the <i>Mechaniker</i>, while
on the way to Prague, when he spoke so earnestly in praise
of English files, my desire to see how files were made became
impatiently strong. Sheffield is famous also for razors; so
there was a sight of two interesting manufactures to be
hoped for when I set out after breakfast to test my credentials.
Fortune favoured me; and, in the works of Messrs.
Rodgers, I saw the men take flat bars of steel and shape
them by the aid of fire and hammer into razor-blades with
remarkable expedition and accuracy. So expert have they
become by long practice, that with the hammer only they
form the blade and tang so nicely, as to leave but little for
the grinders to waste. I saw also the forging of knife-blades,
the making of the handles, the sawing of the buckhorn and
ivory by circular saws, and the heap of ivory-dust which is
sold to knowing cooks, and by them converted into gelatine.
I saw how the knives are fitted together with temporary
rivets to ensure perfect action and finish, before the final
touches are given. And as we went from room to room, and
I thought that each man had been working for years at the
same thing, repeating the same movements over and over
again, I could not help pitying them; for it seemed to me
that they were a sacrifice to the high reputation of English
cutlery. Something more than a People&#x2019;s College and Mechanics&#x2019;
Institute would be needed to counteract the deadening
effect of unvarying mechanical occupation; and where
there is no relish for out-door recreation in the woods and
on the hills, hurtful excitements are the natural consequence.</p>

<p>I had often heard that Sheffield is the most foul-mouthed
town in the kingdom, and my experience unfortunately adds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
confirmation. While in the train coming from Barnsley,
and in my walks about the town, I heard more filthy and
obscene talk than could be heard in Wapping in a year.
Not to trust to the impressions of the day, I inquired of a resident
banker, and he testified that the foul talk that assailed
his ears, was to him, a continual affliction.</p>

<p>On the wall of the grinding-shop a tablet, set up at the
cost of the men, preserves the name of a grinder, who by
excellence of workmanship and long and faithful service,
achieved merit for himself and the trade. At their work the
men sit astride on a low seat in rows of four, one behind the
other, leaning over their stones and wheels. For razors, the
grindstones are small, so as to produce the hollow surface
which favours fineness of edge. From the first a vivid stream
of sparks flies off; but the second is a leaden wheel; the
third is leather touched with crocus, to give the polish to
the steel; and after that comes the whet. To carry off the
dust, each man has a fan-box in front of his wheel, through
which all the noxious floating particles are drawn by the
rapid current of air therein produced. To this fan the
grinders of the present generation owe more years of health
and life than fell to the lot of their fathers, who inhaled the
dust, earned high wages, and died soon of disease of the
lungs. I was surprised by the men&#x2019;s dexterity; by a series
of quick movements, they finished every part of the blade on
the stone and wheels.</p>

<p>From the razors I went to the files, at Moss and Gamble&#x2019;s
manufactory, in another part of the town. There is scarcely
a street from which you cannot see the hills crowned by wood
which environ the town&mdash;that is, at intervals only, through
the thinnest streams of smoke. The town itself is hilly, and
the more you see of the neighbourhood, the more will you
agree with those who say, &#x201c;What a beautiful place Sheffield
would be, if Sheffield were not there!&#x201d;</p>

<p>My first impression of the file-works, combined stacks of
Swedish iron in bars; ranges of steel bars of various shape,
square, flat, three-cornered, round, and half-round; heaps of
broken steel, the fresh edges glittering in the sun; heaps of
broken crucibles, and the roar of furnaces, noise of bellows,
hammer-strokes innumerable, and dust and smoke, and other
things, that to a stranger had very much the appearance of
rubbish and confusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>However, there is no confusion; every man is diligent at
his task; so if you please, reader, we will try and get a
notion of the way in which those bars of Swedish iron are
converted into excellent files. Swedish iron is chosen because
it is the best; no iron hitherto discovered equals it for purity
and strength, and of this the most esteemed is known as
&#x2018;Hoop L,&#x2019; from its brand being an <b>L</b> within a hoop. &#x201c;If
you want good steel to come out of the furnace,&#x201d; say the
knowing ones, &#x201c;you must put good iron in;&#x201d; and some of
them hold that, &#x201c;when the devil is put into the crucible,
nothing but the devil will come out:&#x201d; hence we may believe
their moral code to be sufficient for its purpose. The bars, at
a guess, are about eight feet long, three inches broad, and one
inch thick. To begin the process, they are piled in a furnace
between alternate layers of charcoal, the surfaces kept carefully
from contact, and are there subjected to fire for eight or
nine days. To enable the workmen to watch the process,
small trial pieces are so placed that they can be drawn out for
examination through a small hole in the front of the furnace.
In large furnaces, twelve tons of iron are converted at once.
The long-continued heat, which is kept below the melting-point,
drives off the impurities; the bars, from contact with the
charcoal, become carbonized and hardened; and when the fiery
ordeal is over, they appear thickly bossed with bubbles or blisters,
in which condition they are described as &#x2018;blistered steel.&#x2019;</p>

<p>Now come the operations which convert these blistered bars
into the finished bars of steel above-mentioned, smooth and
uniform of surface, and well-nigh hard as diamond. The
blistered bars are taken from the furnace and broken up into
small pieces; the fresh edges show innumerable crystals of
different dimensions, according to the quality of the iron, and
have much the appearance of frosted silver. The pieces are
carefully assorted and weighed. The weighers judge of the
quality at a glance, and mix the sorts in due proportion in the
scales in readiness for the melters, who put each parcel into
its proper crucible, and drop the crucibles through holes in a
floor into a glowing furnace, where they are left for about
half a day.</p>

<p>The making of the crucibles is a much more important part
of the operation than would be imagined. They must be of
uniform dimensions and quality, or the steel is deteriorated,
and they fail in the fire. They are made on the premises, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
every melting requires new crucibles. In an underground
chamber I saw men at work, treading a large flat heap of
fire-clay into proper consistency, weighing it into lumps of a
given weight; placing these lumps one after the other in a
circular mould, and driving in upon them, with a ponderous
mallet, a circular block of the same form and height as the
mould, but smaller. As the block sinks under the heavy
blows, the clay is forced against the sides of the mould; and
when the block can descend no further, there appears all
round it a dense ring of clay, and the mould is full. Now,
with a dexterous turn, the block is drawn out; the crucible is
separated from the mould, and shows itself as a smooth vase,
nearly two feet in height. The mouth is carefully finished,
and a lid of the same clay fitted, and the crucible is ready for
its further treatment. When placed in the furnace, the lids
are sealed on with soft clay. The man who treads the clay
needs a good stock of patience, for lumps, however small, are
fatal to the crucibles.</p>

<p>When the moment arrived, I was summoned to witness the
casting. The men had tied round their shins pieces of old
sacking, as protection from the heat; they opened the holes
in the floor, knocked off the lid of the crucible, and two of
them, each with tongs, lifted the crucible from the intensely
heated furnace. How it quivered, and glowed, and threw off
sparks, and diffused around a scorching temperature! It
amazed me that the men could bear it. When two crucibles
are lifted out, they are emptied at the same time into the
mould; not hap-hazard, but with care that the streams shall
unite, and not touch the sides of the mould as they fall.
Neglect of this precaution injures the quality. Another precaution
is to shut out cold draughts of air during the casting.
To judge by the ear, you would fancy the men were pouring
out gallons of cream.</p>

<p>The contents of two crucibles form an ingot, short, thick,
and heavy. I saw a number of such ingots in the yard. The
next process is to heat them, and to pass them while hot
between the rollers which convert them into bars of any
required form. I was content to forego a visit to the rolling-mill&mdash;somewhere
in the suburbs&mdash;being already familiar with
the operation of rolling iron.</p>

<p>We have now the steel in a form ready for the file-makers.
Two forgers, one of whom wields a heavy two-handed ham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>mer,
cut the bars into lengths, and after a few minutes of fire
and anvil, the future file is formed, one end at a time, from
tang to point, and stamped. For the half-round files, a suitable
depression is made at one side of the anvil. Then comes
a softening process to prepare the files for the men who grind
or file them to a true form, and for toothing. To cut the
teeth, the man or boy lays the file on a proper bed, takes a
short, hard chisel between the thumb and finger of his left
hand, holds it leaning from him at the required angle, and
strikes a blow with the hammer. The blow produces a nick
with a slight ridge by its side; against this ridge the chisel
is placed for the next stroke, and so on to the next, until, by
multiplied blows, the file is fully toothed. The process takes
long to describe, but is, in reality, expeditious, as testified by
the rapid clatter. Some of the largest files require two men&mdash;one
to hold the chisel, the other to strike. For the teeth of
rasps, a pyramidal punch is used. The different kinds of files
are described as roughs, bastard cut, second cut, smooth, and
dead smooth; besides an extraordinary heavy sort, known as
rubbers. According to the cut, so is the weight of the hammer
employed. Many attempts have been made to cut files
by machinery; but they have all failed. There is something
in the varying touch of human fingers imparting a keenness
to the bite of the file, which the machine with its precise
movements cannot produce&mdash;even as thistle spines excel all
metallic contrivances for the dressing of cloth. And very
fortunate it is that machinery can&#x2019;t do everything.</p>

<p>After the toothing, follows the hardening. The hardener
lays a few files in a fire of cinders; blows the bellows till a
cherry-red heat is produced; then he thrusts the file into a
stratum of charcoal, and from that plunges it into a large bath
of cold water, the cleaner and colder the better. The plunge
is not made anyhow, but in a given direction, and with a
varying movement from side to side, according to the shape of
the file. The metal, as it enters the water, and for some
seconds afterwards, frets and moans piteously; and I expected
to see it fly to pieces with the sudden shock. But good steel
is true; the man draws the file out, squints along its edge,
and if he sees it too much warped, gives it a strain upon a
fulcrum, sprinkling it at the same time with cold water. He
then lays it aside, takes another from the fire, and treats it in
a similar way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>The hardened files are next scrubbed with sand, are dried,
the tangs are dipped into molten lead to deprive them of their
brittleness; the files are rubbed over with oil, and scratched
with a harder piece of metal to test their quality&mdash;that is, an
attempt is made to scratch them. If the files be good, it
ought to fail. They are then taken between the thumb and
finger, and rung to test their soundness; and if no treacherous
crack betray its presence, they are tied up in parcels for sale.</p>

<p>I shall not soon forget the obliging kindness with which explanations
were given and all my questions answered by a
member of the firm, who conducted me over the works. When
we came to the end, and I had witnessed the care bestowed
on the several operations, I no longer wondered that a Bohemian
<i>Mechaniker</i> in the heart of the Continent, or artisans in
any part of the world, should find reason to glory in English
files. Some people are charitable enough to believe that
English files are no unapt examples of English character.</p>

<p>Sheffield is somewhat proud of Chantrey and Montgomery,
and honours Elliott by a statue, which, tall of stature and
unfaithful in likeness, sits on a pedestal in front of the post-office.
I thought that to ramble out to one of the Corn-Law
Rhymer&#x2019;s haunts would be an agreeable way of spending the
afternoon and of viewing the scenery in the neighbourhood of
the town. I paced up the long ascent of Broome Hill&mdash;a not
unpleasing suburb&mdash;to the Glossop road, and when the town
was fairly left behind, was well repaid by the sight of wooded
hills and romantic valleys. Amidst scenery such as that you
may wander on to Wentworth, to Wharncliff, the lair of the
Dragon of Wantley, to Stanedge and Shirecliff, and all the
sites of which Elliott has sung in pictured phrase or words of
fire. We look into the valley of the Rivelin, one of the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Five rivers, like the fingers of a hand,&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that converge upon Sheffield; and were we to explore the
tributary brooks, we should discover grinding wheels kept
going by the current in romantic nooks and hollows. What
a glorious sylvan country this must have been</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&#x201c;&mdash;&mdash;in times of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Locksley o&#x2019;er the hills of Hallam chas&#x2019;d<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Troops of women and girls were busy on the slopes gathering
bilberries, others were washing the stains from their hands
and faces at a roadside spring, others&mdash;who told me they had
been out six miles&mdash;were returning with full baskets to the
town. How they chattered! About an hour&#x2019;s walking brings
you to a descent; on one side the ground falls away precipitously
from the road, on the other rises a rocky cliff, and at
the foot you come to a bridge bestriding a lively brook that
comes out of a wooded glen and runs swiftly down to the
Rivelin. This is the &#x201c;lone streamlet&#x201d; so much loved by the
poet, to which he addresses one of his poems:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Here, if a bard may christen thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#x2019;ll call thee Ribbledin.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I turned from the road, and explored the little glen to its
upper extremity; scrambling now up one bank, now up the
other, wading through rank grass and ferns, striding from one
big stone to another, as compelled by the frequent windings,
rejoiced to find that, except in one particular, it still answered
to the poet&#x2019;s description:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Wildest and lonest streamlet!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gray oaks, all lichen&#x2019;d o&#x2019;er!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush-bristled isles, ye ivied trunks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That marry shore to shore!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thou, gnarl&#x2019;d dwarf of centuries,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose snak&#x2019;d roots twist above me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, for the tongue or pen of Burns,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To tell ye how I love ye!&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The overhanging trees multiply, and the green shade
deepens, as you ascend. At last I came to the waterfall&mdash;the
loneliest nook of all, in which the Rhymer had mused
and listened to the brook, as he says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#x201c;Here, where first murmuring from thine urn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy voice deep joy expresses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down the rock, like music, flows<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wildness of thy tresses.&#x201d;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was just the place for a day-dream. I sat for nearly
an hour, nothing disturbing my enjoyment but now and then
the intrusive thought that my holiday was soon to end.
However, there is good promise of summers yet to come.
I climbed the hill in the rear of the fall, where, knee-deep
in heath and fern, I looked down on the top of the oaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
canopy and a broad reach of the valley; and intended to
return to the town by another road. But the attractions of
the glen drew me back; so I scrambled down it by the way
I came, and retraced my outward route.</p>

<p>The one particular in which the glen differs from Elliott&#x2019;s
description is, that an opening has been made for, as it appeared
to me, a quarry or gravel-pit, from which a loose
slope of refuse extends down to the brook, and encroaches
on its bed, creating a deformity that shocks the feelings by
what seems a desecration. I thought that Ribbledin, at
least, might have been saved from spade and mattock; and
the more so as Sheffield, poisoned by smoke, can ill afford
to lose any place of recreative resort in the neighbourhood.
It may be that I felt vexed; for after my return to London,
I addressed a letter on the subject to the editor of the
<i>Sheffield Independent</i>, in the hope that by calling public attention
thereto, the hand of the spoiler might be stayed.</p>

<p>As I walked down to the railway-station the next morning
in time for the first train, many of the chimneys had just
began to vent their murky clouds, and the smoke falling into
the streets darkened the early sunlight; and Labour, preparing
to &#x201c;bend o&#x2019;er thousand anvils,&#x201d; went with unsmiling
face to his daily task.</p>

<p>Away sped the train for Manchester; and just as the Art
Treasures Exhibition was opening for the day, I alighted at
the door.</p>

<p>Less than half an hour spent in the building sufficed to
show that it was a work of the north, not of the south.
There was a manifest want of attention to the fitness of
things, naturally to be looked for in a county where the bulk
of the population have yet so much to learn; where manufacturers,
with a yearly income numbered by thousands, can
find no better evening resort than the public-house; where
so much of the thinking is done by machinery, and where
steam-engines are built with an excellence of workmanship
and splendour of finish well-nigh incredible.</p>

<p>For seven hours did I saunter up and down and linger
here and there, as my heart inclined&mdash;longest before the old
engravings. And while my eye roved from one beautiful
object to another, I wondered more and more that the <i>Times</i>
and some other newspapers had often expressed surprise that
so few comparatively of the working-classes visited the Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>chester
Exhibition. Those best acquainted with the working-classes,
as a mass, know full well how little such an
exhibition as that appeals to their taste and feelings. To appreciate
even slightly such paintings and curiosities of art as
were there displayed, requires an amount of previous cultivation
rare in any class, and especially so in the working-classes.
For the cream of Manchester society, the Exhibition
was a fashionable exchange, where they came to parade
from three to five in the afternoon&mdash;the ladies exhibiting a
circumference of crinoline far more ample than I have ever
seen elsewhere; and of them and their compeers it would be
safe to argue that those attracted by real love of art were but
tens among the thousands who went for pastime and fashion.</p>

<p>To me it seems, that of late, we have had rather too much
talk about art; by far too much flattery of the artist and
artificer, whereby the one with genius and the one with
handicraft feel themselves alike ill-used if they are not always
before the eyes of the world held up to admiration. And so,
instead of a heart working inspired by love, we have a hand
working inspired by hopes of praise. The masons who
carved those quaint carvings at Patrington worked out the
thought that was in them lovingly, because they had the
thought, and not the mere ambitious shadow of a thought.
And their work remains admirable for all time, for their
hearts were engaged therein as well as heads and hands.
But now education and division of labour are to do everything;
that is, if flattery fail not; and in wood-engraving
we have come to the pass that one man cuts the clouds,
another the trees, another the buildings, and another the
animal figures; while on steel plates the clouds are &#x201c;executed&#x201d;
by machinery. For my part, I would be willing to
barter a good deal of modern art for the conscience and common
honesty which it has helped to obscure.</p>

<p>We are too apt to forget certain conclusions which ought
to be remembered; and these are, according to Mr. Penrose,
that &#x201c;No government, however imperial, can create true
taste, or combine excellence with precipitation; that money
is lavished in vain where good sense guides neither the design
nor the execution; and that art with freedom, of which
she is one manifestation, will not condescend to visit the
land where she is not invited by the spontaneous instincts,
and sustained by the unfettered efforts of the people.&#x201d;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

<span class="smaller">A SHORT CHAPTER TO END WITH.</span></h2>

<p>Here, reader, we part company. The last day of July has
come, and whatever may be my inclinations or yours, I must
return to London, and report myself to-morrow morning at
head-quarters. There will be time while on the way for a
few parting words.</p>

<p>If the reading of my book stir you up to go and see Yorkshire
with your own eyes and on your own legs, you will, I
hope, be able to choose a centre of exploration. For the
coast, Flamborough and Whitby would be convenient; for
Teesdale, Barnard Castle; for Craven, with its mountains,
caves, and scars, Settle; and for the dales, Kettlewell and
Aysgarth. Ripon is a good starting-point for Wensleydale;
and York, situate where the three Ridings meet, offers
railway routes in all directions. My own route, as you have
seen, was somewhat erratic, more so than you will perhaps
approve; but it pleased me, and if a man cannot please
himself while enjoying a holiday, when shall he?</p>

<p>A glance at the map will show you how large a portion
of the county is here unnoticed; a portion large enough for
another volume. The omissions are more obvious to you
than to me, because I can fill them up mentally by recollections
of what I saw during my first sojourn in Yorkshire. A
month might be well spent in rambles and explorations in the
north-west alone, along the border of Westmoreland; Knaresborough
and the valley of the Nidd will generously repay a
travel; Hallamshire, though soiled by Sheffield smoke, is full
of delightful scenery; and if it will gratify you to see one of
the prettiest country towns in England, go to Doncaster. And
should you desire further information, as doubtless you will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
read Professor Phillips&#x2019;s <i>Rivers, Mountains, and Sea Coast of
Yorkshire</i>&mdash;a book that takes you all through the length and
breadth of the county. It tells you where to look for rare
plants, where for fossils; reveals the geological history;
glances lovingly at all the antiquities; and imparts all the
information you are likely to want concerning the inhabitants,
from the earliest times, the climate, and even the terrestrial
magnetism. I am under great obligations to it, not only for
its science and scholarship, but for the means it afforded me,
combined with previous knowledge, of choosing a route.</p>

<p>As regards distances, my longest walk, as mentioned at the
outset, was twenty-six miles; the next longest, from Brough
to Hawes, twenty-two; and all the rest from fourteen to
eighteen miles. Hence, in all the rambles, there is no risk
of over-fatigue. I would insert a table of distances, were it
not best that you should inquire for yourself when on the
spot, and have a motive for talking to the folk on the way.
As for the railways, buy your time-table in Yorkshire; it
will enlighten you on some of the local peculiarities, and
prove far more useful than the lumbering, much-perplexed
<i>Bradshaw</i>.</p>

<p>Of course the Ordnance maps are the best and most complete;
but considering that the sheets on the large scale, for
Yorkshire alone, would far outweigh your knapsack, they
are out of the question for a pedestrian. Failing these, you
will find Walker&#x2019;s maps&mdash;one for each Riding&mdash;sufficiently
trustworthy, with the distances from town to town laid down
along the lines of road, and convenient for the pocket withal.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written concerning the high cost
of travelling in England as compared with the Continent,
but is it really so? Experience has taught me that the
reverse is the fact, and for an obvious reason&mdash;the much
shorter distance to be travelled to the scene of your wanderings.
In going to Switzerland, for example, there are seven
hundred and fifty miles to Basel, before you begin to walk,
and the outlay required for such a journey as that is not
compensated by any trifling subsequent advantage, if such
there be. Some folk travel as if they were always familiar
with turtle and champagne at home, and therefore should
not complain if they are made to pay for the distinction. But
if you are content to go simply on your own merits, wishing
nothing better than to enjoy a holiday, it is perfectly possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
while on foot, to travel for four-and-sixpence a day, sometimes
even less. And think not that because you choose the
public-house instead of the hotel you will suffer in regard to
diet, or find any lack of comfort and cleanliness. The advantage
in all these respects, as I know full well, is not unfrequently
with the house of least pretension. Moreover, you
are not looked on as a mere biped, come in to eat, drink,
and sleep, by a waiter who claims his fee as a right; but a
show of kindly feeling awaits you, and the lassie who ministers
to your wants accepts your gift of a coin with demonstrations
of thankfulness. And, again, the public-house shows you far
more variety of unsophisticated life and character than you
could ever hope to witness in an hotel. Certain friends of
mine, newly-wedded, passed a portion of their honeymoon
at the <i>Jolly Herring</i> at Penmaenmawr, with much more
contentment to themselves than at the large hotels they afterwards
visited in the Principality, and at one-half the cost.</p>

<p>The sum total of my walking amounts to three hundred
and seventy-five miles. If you go down to Yorkshire, trusting,
as I hope, to your own legs for most of your pleasure,
you will perhaps outstrip me. At any rate, you will discover
that travelling in England is not less enjoyable than on the
Continent; maybe you will think it more so, especially if,
instead of merely visiting one place after another, you really
do travel. You require no ticket-of-leave in the shape of a
passport from cowardly emperor or priest-ridden king, and
may journey at will from county to county and parish to
parish, finding something fresh and characteristic in each,
and all the while with the consciousness that it is your own
country:</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
